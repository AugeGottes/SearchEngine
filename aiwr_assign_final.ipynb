they were among the el-aurians rescued by the enterprise-b in 2293. guinan explains that soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon, which is a portal to the \"nexus\", an extra-dimensional realm where time has no meaning and anyone can experience whatever they desire. picard and data determine that soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon due to the uncertainty that the ship will survive long enough to ensure his success, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, which alters gravitational forces in the neighborhood, and that he will attempt to reenter the nexus on veridian iii by destroying its sun—and, by extension, veridian iv\\'s quarter-billion inhabitants.\\r\\nupon entering the veridian system, enterprise makes contact with the duras bird of prey. picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for la forge, but insists that he be transported to soran\\'s location first. la forge is returned to enterprise, but with a small camera implanted in his visor. this causes him to inadvertently reveal enterprise\\'s shield frequency, allowing the duras sisters to fire weapons directly through the shields and inflict crippling damage on enterprise. enterprise destroys the bird of prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. commander william riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive. the shock wave from the star drive\\'s destruction sends the saucer crashing to the surface of veridian iii.\\r\\npicard fails to talk soran out of his plan and is too late to stop him from launching his missile. the collapse of the veridian star alters the course of the nexus ribbon as predicted, and it sweeps picard and soran away while the shock wave from the star obliterates everything in the system. in the nexus, picard finds himself surrounded by the family he never had, including a wife and children, but realizes it is an illusion. he is confronted by an \"echo\" of guinan. after being told that he may leave whenever he chooses and go wherever and whenever he wishes, guinan sends him to meet kirk, also safe in the nexus. though kirk is at first reluctant to leave, he likewise comes to the eventual realization that nothing in the nexus is real. picard convinces kirk to return to veridian iii, rather than earlier at amargosa, assuring him that stopping saron will fulfill his desire to make a difference.\\r\\nthe two leave the nexus, with picard choosing to have them arrive on veridian iii only minutes before soran launches the missile. kirk distracts soran long enough for picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill soran. kirk is fatally injured by a fall during the encounter; as he dies, picard assures him that he made a difference. picard buries kirk on a hillside before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the wreckage of the enterprise saucer. three federation starships enter orbit to retrieve enterprise\\'s survivors, but the ship itself cannot be salvaged. as riker laments that he will never sit in the captain\\'s chair of the ship, picard muses that given the name\\'s legacy, this won\\'t be the last ship to carry the name enterprise.',\n",

comments on how lucky he feels that he is getting a book published at age 23 and that he is in a relationship with cathy (\"moving too fast\"). elsewhere at an audition, cathy makes a call to her disinterested agent: it seems her career isn\\'t going the way she planned, as she does not move on to the dance audition.\\r\\nin late 2009 and early 2010, cathy attends multiple social functions for the promotion of jamie\\'s novel and for celebrating its success (63 weeks as a bestseller). she sings about how his newfound fame and success in writing have changed their lives and jokes about how

and put herself and her dreams second to his new success. but she believes this sacrifice is the best way to support and love jamie (\"a part of that\").\\r\\nafter a horrible day working as a bartender, cathy comes home to an excited jamie. he tells her a new story he has written about an old tailor named schmuel, who had given up on his dreams but is able to turn back time, and right past wrongs with the help of a magical clock. the story is complete with dancing and decorating the house and cathy with christmas decorations. after the story jamie compares cathy to schmuel and

he\\'s living out his dream. he accuses her of being unsupportive of his career just because hers is failing (\"if i didn\\'t believe in you\"). cathy ultimately refuses to go with jamie.\\r\\nan

(he doesn\\'t drink.) she remarks that the bartender sol (rahul panday) knows all her secrets. while leaving the bar, their car is attacked by an apparently drunk man, who seems to know teesta. teesta urges pratyush to leave fast. when he brings her back home, he realizes that his car keys are missing. he waits as she looks for them.\\r\\nwhen teesta gets into her bedroom, she is mysteriously murdered. she stumbles into pratyush\\'s arms, fatally stabbed, and collapses. scared and confused, pratyush leaves immediately. one of the neighbors, a weird and on-and-off senile old fellow called murli mansukhani (shauket baig) sees him leave.\\r\\nwhen the cops begin to investigate, they find that teesta had a roommate sonali (jasmine) and that sonali is engaged to a prominent businessman, k.k. menon (sanjay singh). the investigating officer, and the hero of this movie, inspector arvind khanvilkar (rahul dev), starts his work. the prime suspect is an unwitting pratyush because he was the last person to see teesta alive.\\r\\na somewhat convoluted plot evolves. sonali has several dark secrets and a good-for-nothing brother prashant (subrotto dutta). teesta was somehow connected to sonali\\'s dark past. menon knows this and wanted to wipe out everything, including prashant. he has prashant kidnapped, and later he tells sol to bump off prashant. there is a three-way fight among them. pratyush arrives upon the scene and witnesses two more murders. a dying prashant advises pratyush to go to sonali at the earliest. in the meantime, the weird old man of 88 antop hill, murli, recalls that he had seen pratyush and follows him to blackmail him. when pratyush asks him to get lost, he goes to sonali\\'s house and tries to blackmail her. aslam durrani visits pratyush and, seeing him, thinks he has probably committed the crime, saying that pratyush would better leave the city and that he wouldn\\'t want anything to do with the latter anymore.\\r\\npratyush contacts the cops but a dimwitted cop sternly asks him to surrender, as the police have found the murder weapon and a blood stained shirt, with pratyush\\'s diary stating 88 antop hill on the fateful date at his house. pratyush panics and goes to sonali to convey prashant\\'s message to her. she does not listen to what he says. here menon and the good inspector show up as well.\\r\\nat this point the crux arises — the inspector says that he has found out that sonali is actually \"sonali shah\", and she was married already to the deceased neeraj shah; it was sonali who killed him because he wouldn\\'t give her a divorce to marry menon. he also says that neeraj\\'s house was ransacked by sonali to find the marriage certificate.\\r\\nat this point, arvind goes to the fridge and finds murli mansukhani lying stabbed in it! the truth is then out. it is known that sonali murdered neeraj and hid his corpse in the fridge and murdered murli because he opened the fridge out of curiosity and found neeraj\\'s corpse. arvind also reveals that sonali killed teesta. sonali says it was because teesta knew about her marriage with neeraj, and used to blackmail her, saying she will make it known to menon. it was sonali who had followed pratyush and teesata on the fateful night back to 88 antop hill, secretly climbed into teesta\\'s bedroom and slit her throat. she further followed pratyush and leaves the knife in his house to implicate him. it is then revealed that menon has murdered prashant, at which sonali is shocked.\\r\\nat this point, menon makes a last effort to save himself and sonali. he tries to bribe arvind with 10 million, saying that he must arrest poor pratyush on charges of all the murders. to this, arvind agrees and shoots pratyush in the shoulder. but the wounded pratyush releases gas from the cylinder nearby and threatens to light his cigarette lighter. while he grabs arvind\\'s phone and tries to call police, menon attacks him and stabs him on the sofa, and arvind quickly turns out the gas. but the wounded pratyush pulls out menon\\'s revolver, kicks him off and shoots him through a cushion.\\r\\nat this point, a dumbfounded sonali picks up a pistol and threatens to kill pratyush. arvind tells her not to, but she pulls the trigger — only to find that the gun is empty.\\r\\narvind then apologizes to pratyush, saying he had to wound the latter or else menon would\\'ve killed pratyush. sonali is then arrested on charges of multiple homicide and attempt to kill pratyush.\\r\\nthe film ends with the inspector relieving pratyush of all charges in the case and requesting him to take care of a pet dog. pratyush\\'s wife and child return.',\n",

back to his and candy’s hotel room where he secretly tells him the real reason for this assignment; he wants ruby to kill santos because the people that vitali works for feel that santos has outgrown his usefulness to them. vitali gives ruby an 8\\xa0mm film camera that has a pistol encased in it to carry out the killing. but that evening, ruby instead kills vitali on the dock near the prison and springs santos from his cell by bribing the guards, and then he, santos, and candy flee cuba aboard vitali’s boat back to america. after arriving in new orleans, ruby makes contact with david ferrie, an old friend from his days in chicago, to supply him with the necessary papers enabling santos to re-enter the country. shortly after, ruby and candy return to dallas, while santos goes off on his own.\\r\\nseveral months later, ruby, still managing the carousel club in which candy is now the star attraction, has an encounter one evening when candy’s estranged and abusive husband, hank, shows up and confronts her after the show in her apartment, wanting her to return to him. ruby beats up candy/sheryl ann’s husband and warns him never to come back to the club.\\r\\nthe next day, a mysterious man, identifying himself only by his name of \\'maxwell\\', pays a visit to ruby at the currently closed club to talk with him about the killing of vitali and of the release of santos from cuba. with a clearly implied threat of arrest and incarceration, maxwell wants ruby to redeem himself to the people that maxwell works for by being an informant for him on santos, who has since opened up a new hotel and casino in las vegas since his return to the united states as well as santos’ affiliates. maxwell supplies ruby with a mini-tape recorder to assist, and ruby makes the assumption that maxwell works for the cia, which maxwell neither denies or admits.\\r\\nruby and candy travel to las vegas and check into santos’ new hotel, where a gala event is taking place that involves a stage performance by singer tony montana. ruby is also suspicious when a helicopter arrives and drops off the president of the united states, john f. kennedy, who is attending the event. candy attends the event with david ferrie, who sits with her at the table where the president is sitting, while ruby sits with santos and several like-minded people who are clearly connected to organized crime. recording the conversation, the men want ruby to smuggle into cuba “special cigars” for fidel castro to assassinate him for the loss of all their casinos and business since the 1959 takeover. when ruby excuses himself to go outside, he meets with maxwell in the hotel parking lot, where he drives ruby outside the city and reveals another assignment for him to partake in the assassination of a prominent official, implying it to be castro.\\r\\nthe next day, candy tells ruby that the people that santos works with want her to stay in las vegas to perform as a singer in their hotels, thanks to some presidential connections that she managed to get hold of. ruby returns to dallas alone, while he makes use of free time by shooting at watermelons and other targets from a distance in preparation for his next assassination assignment.\\r\\nsometime later, ruby talks with lenny, an old friend of his, about assignments for cia associates and lenny tells ruby that to take out a \"target\" relies on two or more rifle marksmen and a \"patsy\" or \"fall guy\" to be caught in order to place all the blame for the crime to divert suspicion away from the investigating authorities.\\r\\nmeanwhile, diego the bartender meets with david ferrie where they travel to new orleans where they make contact with lee harvey oswald, whom they ask to talk about going in on a job.\\r\\nback in dallas, ruby meets with santos, sam giaccana, and their men at another meeting where giaccana tells ruby that his assignment to take out castro has been canceled because another matter has come up. giaccana tells ruby that the cia has been having troubles with president kennedy over the cuba issue and wanting to reveal the cia’s true nature. after ruby leaves, giaccana meets with maxwell for a talk.\\r\\nreturning to his club, ruby sees candy there, who tells him that she quit her career tour which included performances for the president because she felt they were taking advantage of her and her charms. it is implied that candy had shared some intimate time with kennedy and possibly others. while ruby and candy decide to revise the club with a new classy act as a singing club, he begins to figure out what maxwell and the mob associates are doing: planning a high-level assassination. ruby tells his boss, proby, that from his views and experiences in the past several months, the cia and the mafia work together to stage and carry out contract killings, and get away with it by subcontracting third parties to carry out the work. proby has some doubts, but he tells ruby to leave the matter alone for he cannot blow the lid on a complex conspiracy such as this.\\r\\non november 22, 1963, jfk arrives in dallas where maxwell meets with oswald, diego, and two other henchmen, where he tells them their assignments. while ruby is at a newspaper office to file a new listing for his club, candy is watching the president’s limo convoy ride through the city. it is shown that diego, with oswald as the handler, shoots kennedy from the sixth-floor window of the dallas book depository, while the second assassin, and his handler, fire the fatal shot, killing kennedy from the grassy knoll section near the building to the building.\\r\\nafter watching the events on a tv set, a distraught ruby returns to his club, where proby is rummaging through his desk to look for the audio tape of the recording of the conversation ruby had in las vegas with santos and his associates, but the tape is gone. ruby tells proby, who has not heard about the assassination, that their enemies have won. the following day, david ferrie pays a visit to ruby at the club where they watch a tv broadcast about the arrest of lee harvey oswald and that he also was arrested for killing officer tippit, a regular customer at the club. ferrie tells ruby to forget that they ever met and that he shouldn’t do anything stupid for he calls ruby only a \"small time hood\". ruby vows he will make the world understand.\\r\\nthe next day, ruby goes to the dallas county jail where oswald is being transferred and kills him. ruby is immediately arrested by the police—just as he wanted them to. in jail, ruby refuses to give a statement to his lawyer about his motivation and demands that he be taken to washington to testify before a senate committee about what he knows. at ruby’s trial, he refuses to offer an insanity defense for the murder of oswald and is convicted and sentenced to death. ruby sees maxwell as one of the spectators during the trial and knows that maxwell had some hand in work behind the scenes that has led to his conviction. ruby appeals the verdict, but aware that the conspirators are monitoring his visits, continues to demand that he be taken to washington to testify, but he is refused.\\r\\nseveral months later, while still in prison awaiting an appeal, candy visits ruby to offer him moral support for his actions, while he tells her not to visit him again and to move far away so the members of the conspiracy will not find her. after candy leaves ruby for good, he remains in jail while over the next several months, he thinks that the conspirators are slowly killing him inside when he is forcibly given injections for his failing health. in a final disclaimer, it is said that ruby died from cancer in jail in 1967 and that his request to testify before a senate hearing was never granted.',\n",

              " 'johnny baxter (dean jones) is at his corporate middle class job when a probate attorney (david white) tells him that his recently deceased uncle, jacob barnesworth, has left him sole ownership of the lucrative grand imperial hotel in the fictional town of silver hill, colorado. a letter written by barnesworth claims that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. baxter, clearly chafing under the dehumanizing conditions at the office, views this as a golden opportunity.\\r\\nbaxter quits his job in a grand spectacle and moves his family to colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. the family finds it to be an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, jesse mccord (harry morgan), living in the shed. initially, baxter is inclined to turn mccord out for what appeared to be breaking and entering until he is pressured by his family—mainly his children—to allow mccord to stay. mccord offers his services as a bartender, but baxter assigns him the job of bellhop, which mccord takes with a characteristically easygoing nature.\\r\\nsome time later, baxter and his wife are walking on the hills behind the hotel, trying to decide what to do about the hotel. with no real attractions nearby, they are unsure what, if anything, they could do with the property until a chance meeting with wally, a local boy employed by the gas station, out for a ride on his snowmobile. he apologizes for making tracks in baxter\\'s snow and is about to leave when baxter stops him to ask what he meant. wally explains that the grand imperial sits on a huge amount of property, \"about as far as you can see,\" as he puts it. baxter realizes that the hilly terrain is exactly the attraction the hotel needs; they can turn the hill adjacent to the hotel into a ski lodge.\\r\\nbaxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. local banker martin ridgeway (keenan wynn) expresses great interest in baxter\\'s daring idea, but also offers to buy the lodge in order to convert it into a boys\\' school in honor of the deceased uncle. baxter declines. ridgeway, in turn, declines to give baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management, likely making his business venture a failure. all during this exchange, ridgeway\\'s secretary appears quite agitated, but does not speak up. baxter leaves the bank without a loan, but determined to find one.\\r\\nbaxter searches for funding elsewhere and finds a friendly banker in the next town named mr. wainwright (george kirkpatrick) who is interested in baxter\\'s venture. wainwright agrees to meet with baxter at a ski lodge — baxter, not willing to make the same mistake as he did with ridgeway by admitting he knows nothing about hotels or skiing, claims to be an avid skier. wainwright, taking baxter at his word, takes him to a black diamond run called \"nightmare alley.\" faking an injury, baxter convinces wainwright to start without him. however, after knocking down a ski rack, baxter is shoved by an irate skier, sending him down the run anyway. after quite a few close calls, not to mention downing more than a few other skiers, baxter ends up crashing into a tree. the sensational story is picked up by the local press, which gives the chaos and injuries caused by baxter\\'s run a fair amount of coverage.\\r\\nwhile he is recovering, martin ridgeway gives baxter a check for $3,000, taking feigned pity on him. baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. meanwhile, local bumpkin wally perkins (michael mcgreevey) works with jesse to repair the hot water heater. the water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. ridgeway\\'s check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift baxter had in mind. jesse comes to the rescue by pulling an old donkey engine out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and using it as a makeshift ski lift.\\r\\nthe restored hotel opens to little fanfare, receiving few customers for several days. when wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. the baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort.\\r\\nall goes well until wally commences ski training classes. having never taught skiing before, wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge while clinging to a pine tree. using the donkey engine and a rope to lower john baxter down the mountain to rescue wally, jesse accidentally jostles a loose piece of lit firewood onto one of the ropes anchoring the engine in place. baxter rescues wally, who suffers a broken arm. the burning rope tears, setting the donkey engine free. it slides down the mountain with baxter in tow, still roped to the machine after having rescued wally. the engine plows through the hotel. all of the guests check out, leaving the baxters out of money once again.\\r\\njohn baxter sheepishly goes back to ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which ridgeway flatly refuses. baxter notices a sign for the silver hills snowmobile race, with $5,000 prize, a prize that has been won by ridgeway for the last several runs of the race. though baxter has never used a snowmobile, he assumes wally can drive his slapdash snowmobile. unfortunately, wally\\'s broken arm from his skiing accident prevents his involvement. baxter decides to drive the snowmobile himself, with jesse as his partner. baxter\\'s wife, furious that he would risk his own safety and health and certain that the lodge has become an obsession that has eclipsed his duties to his family, threatens to leave.\\r\\nthe day of the race, 75-year-old jesse has second thoughts about partaking in the race aboard wally\\'s decrepit snowmobile (dubbed \"the mighty mongrel\"). baxter reveals that his wife has indeed left with the children, probably for denver. after a rocky start, baxter and mccord actually end up passing much of the pack, but a series of unfortunate turns and one unexpected shortcut ends up breaking one of the snowmobile\\'s skis. heading into town both in the lead and under full power due to a broken throttle, baxter plows into a snowbank, breaking the other ski. ridgeway makes the same mistake, and the two end up on the final stretch only seconds apart. though they come close, baxter and mccord narrowly miss the finish line. ridgeway wins first place, and baxter ends up riding the snowmobile for hours as it will not shut off or stop. as he returns to town well after dark, his snowmobile towed by a horse, he finds his wife waiting for him.\\r\\nthe next day, ridgeway brings the deed transfer papers to the lodge for baxter to sign. an impassioned plea by baxter for an extension is again denied, and when baxter presses the issue, ridgeway threatens to begin the foreclosure process, but offers to buy the resort from baxter for practically nothing, again mentioning his jacob barnesworth school for boys plan. ridgeway\\'s secretary miss wigginton (mary wickes) happens to be present during this exchange, and blows her stack in front of ridgeway, telling everyone the truth: the property includes several hundred acres of pine timberland originally donated to the local indian tribes by barnesworth for as long as the tribe inhabited the land. as the tribe has moved away or died out, the land reverts to the estate. ridgeway wants to buy the resort in order to log the highly valuable timber located on the property. jesse adds that the land the town was built on was granted by jacob farnsworth on the condition that several buildings be erected, including two hospitals (one an animal hospital) and library. baxter\\'s son notes that he has not seen a library, and, in genuine confusion, asks why the land has not reverted to baxter. wigginton realizes that he is absolutely right, and that silver hill is in violation of the grant, meaning that the entire town is built on land now owned by baxter — including ridgeway\\'s bank. ridgeway, now finding himself on the back foot, finds himself being pressed by baxter for an extension on the loan, which is quickly granted. baxter pushes his advantage, and ridgeway quickly agrees to loan baxter the money necessary to not only repair but greatly expand the resort.',\n",

an all-female motorcycle gang called the maneaters. the maneaters hang out in an abandoned house and hold weekly motorcycle races at an abandoned airport runway. the leader of the maneaters, the tough-minded queen (betty connell), holds the races and the winner of each race gets first pick from the \"stud line\".\\r\\nthe race begins and karen is the winner, with queen coming in second.

whom are male groupies to the all-women gang. karen picks out her usual \"stud\", a friendly guy named bill... the same one she has picked for four weeks in a row. however, this is strictly forbidden among the maneaters for according to their code, no maneater is allowed to be attached to anyone or anything but the gang. one of the fastest held rules of the group is that \"all men are mothers\" and no maneater falls in love.\\r\\nhoney pot, a teenage \"mascot\" and follower of the maneaters who wants to join, reports to queen her suspicions about karen\\'s attraction to bill. after debating about it with her fellow members, queen tells honey pot to inform karen that she is to come to the runway that evening. when karen shows up as expected, queen and the rest of the gang angrily decrees to her a punishing ultimatum, karen is to participate in the beating then dragging of bill for face expulsion of the gang. karen gets on her motorcycle and is forced to drag bill, who is tied, beaten, and bruised behind her down the entire stretch of the runway and back. bill is dead after this, and karen\\'s allegiance and loyalty to the gang is proven.\\r\\nanother evening later, honey pot is finally granted membership into the gang. in a hazing ritual, honey pot has her left hand cut open in a blood oath and made to kiss all the members of the gang to prove her sisterhood. next, honey pot

townspeople (out of fear of retaliation) refuse to press charges. as a result, the police make no successful arrests. unable to pin anything on the maneaters, the police are forced to let them go, only giving queen and the rest of the maneaters a warning to stay out of trouble.\\r\\nanother week later, the stud line competition is again on, and queen and the rest of the maneaters head off to the runway for another motorcycle race only to discover that an all-male gang are hanging out along the runway. what was supposed to be a fun-spirited race turns into an all-out brawl. queen and the

              " 'jane coslaw (follows) serves as the narrator of the film as well as the older sister of the main protagonist of the movie, her younger, paraplegic brother marty (haim) and their parents nan and bob. their rocky relationship changes after a series of murders in their small rural town of tarker\\'s mills, maine starting in the spring of 1976.\\r\\nfirst, a railroad worker, arnie westrum (gammon), is decapitated by a werewolf after noticing its tracks. the county coroner believes that arnie passed out on the railroad tracks and was run over by a train. soon after, a local woman, stella randolph (wendy walker), prepares to commit suicide because she is unmarried and pregnant. before she can act, she is brutally murdered in her own bedroom. this murder goes unsolved and the townsfolk become worried. the next victim, a redneck named milt sturmfuller (james a. baffico), whose daughter is marty\\'s girlfriend, hears a racket in his shed. believing teenagers are making mischief, sturmfuller plans to scare them off with his shotgun. instead, he encounters the werewolf and is promptly killed. his family leaves town. next to die is teenager brady kincaid (joe wright), marty\\'s troublemaking best friend, who stayed out too late one night while flying a kite. he is then killed by the werewolf off screen.\\r\\nafter brady\\'s death, citizens led by local gun shop owner andy fairton (smitrovich) form a vigilante justice group. although local sheriff joe haller (o\\'quinn) and his lone deputy (hart) attempt to stop the citizens, the officers relent after being berated by brady\\'s father (broadhurst). in the middle of the melee, baptist reverend lester lowe (mcgill) attempts to prevent the townsfolk from causing further bloodshed. after the vigilantes go out hunting for the killer, several are attacked and killed, including bartender owen knopfler (tierney). the survivors later deny seeing anything unusual. after the vigilantes are attacked, reverend lowe dreams that he is presiding over a mass funeral when his congregation—including the bodies in the caskets—begins to transform into werewolves before his eyes and attack him. he awakens screaming and asks god to \"let it end.\"\\r\\nas a result of the mounting unsolved murders, curfews are put in place and the annual fair and fireworks show is cancelled. the coslaws decide to have their own backyard party and invite nan\\'s alcoholic black sheep brother, uncle red (busey). red gives the gift of a custom-built wheelchair/motorcycle to marty, which he nicknames the \"silver bullet\". he also gives marty a pile of fireworks so that he can have his own celebration. marty uses the silver bullet to go out in the middle of the night to a small bridge deep in the woods where he lights the fireworks. unbeknownst to marty, the fireworks get the werewolf\\'s attention and it confronts him. he barely escapes with his life by launching a rocket into the left eye of the creature.\\r\\nmarty enlists jane\\'s help to look for someone with a newly injured or missing left eye. the search is conducted under the cover of the church\\'s bottle drive, so as not to arouse suspicion. when jane turns her bottles in, she discovers that reverend lowe is missing his left eye- as well as noticing knopfler\\'s broken baseball bat, called \"the peacemaker\", hidden among the bottles. realizing that no adult would believe his fantastic story, marty begins sending anonymous notes to reverend lowe telling him that he knows who he is, what he is, and that he should commit suicide in order to stop the killings. a cat-and-mouse chase ensues between the reverend and the siblings. at one point lowe tries to run marty, who is driving the silver bullet, off the road with his car. when marty is trapped under a closed covered bridge, lowe, whose sanity has been fractured by his condition, tries to rationalize the murders he has committed: he cites randolph\\'s murder during her suicide attempt as his effort to save her soul (and as rationalization for not killing himself); westrum was a severe alcoholic; he implies that sturmfuller was abusing his wife and possibly his daughter (this is made explicit in the novel); and the vigilantes intended to murder someone in cold blood (lowe\\'s logic cannot explain brady\\'s murder, however). lowe then apologizes and tells marty that he is going to drown him in the river when marty is unwittingly saved by local farmer elmer zinneman.\\r\\nthe siblings tell red about their letter-writing campaign to reverend lowe. after calming down the furious red, they manage to convince him that lowe is connected to the murders and attempted to kill marty: the silver bullet has dents and a scrape of blue paint that matches lowe\\'s car. unable to deny the evidence in front of him, red heads straight to sheriff haller. although red admits that he has his doubts, and haller does not believe lowe to be a killer, red nonetheless persuades the sheriff to investigate. that night, haller, still skeptical but desperate to find the killer, is shocked to discover evidence that at least some of marty\\'s story may be true. haller suddenly finds lowe, who has locked himself in his garage to restrain himself from further killings, but before haller can arrest him, lowe transforms and kills haller by striking him numerous times on the head with the peacemaker.\\r\\nmarty and jane both know that with haller out of the way, the werewolf now has an easy path to come after them. marty theorizes that lowe transforms more often than just the full moon, but that when the moon is at its peak he loses all his humanity and becomes more driven to kill; thus, he will attack marty on the next full moon, when he is most unrestrained. desperate and running out of options, they convince red to take jane\\'s silver cross and marty\\'s silver medallion to someone who can melt it down into a silver bullet. under the guise of marty having just \"discovered the lone ranger\", red has a local gunsmith make the bullet; the gunsmith proves to be a master at his craft, making the bullet so it will be accurate. when red asks an offhand question, \"… what the heck are you gonna shoot a forty-four bullet at anyway, made outta silver?\" the gunsmith replies, \"how \\'bout a werewolf?\"\\r\\non halloween, red shows up at the coslaws with some fortuitous news: he has won a romantic getaway to new york, but since he separated from his wife, he gives the tickets to nan and bob. questioned by marty and jane, red reveals that he bought the tickets as a ruse to get their parents to safety. with the now full moon in the sky, they head inside to wait for the werewolf. despite their best efforts, the three fall asleep and are startled awake when red (who has fallen asleep with a lit cigarette in his fingers), burns himself, jumps up and drops the gun, nearly setting it off. red begins to doubt that the werewolf is real, much less going to show up, and orders marty and jane to bed. jane suddenly screams in horror as she sees the werewolf looking at her from a living room window, although when red looks he finds nothing. red starts to think that he is being fooled by the children and unloads the pistol. at that moment the werewolf tears the power cables out of the box and cuts the power to the house, leaving the trio with only the light from the fireplace. the werewolf then smashes through the wall of the house, attacking them. despite red\\'s best efforts he is tossed around like a rag doll and jane is suspended in midair.as uncle red continues to receive multiple wwe style body slams into various pieces of household furniture,marty manages to retrieve the cartridge (which was tossed around in the melee and had fallen through a heating vent in the floor) and shoots the werewolf in the right eye with the silver bullet. the corpse turns back into reverend lowe and has one last spasm before dying. afterwards marty and jane both say, \"i love you\" and the narrator then says that she too can now say it.',\n",

his lack of effort to find a jewish wife often results in his mother, ruth (anne bancroft) and other women of his congregation setting him up on blind dates, much to his dismay. the two men show a close bond, even in their professions, where the two are planning the opening of a jointly sponsored community center. in its earlier days, the friendship included a third party. via flashbacks and reminiscent musings, anna reilly (jenna elfman) is introduced: she met jake and brian in middle school, after beating up a bully who was picking on them. the three became great friends, and enjoyed their childhood together. unfortunately, anna\\'s father got a new job that resulted in the reillys moving to california, and ultimately she lost touch with brian and jake.\\r\\nsixteen years later, anna calls her old friends out of the blue and the friendship is rekindled when her company temporarily reassigns her to a new york position. feelings quickly begin to run deeper than before, as anna, despite her workaholic tendencies, is as vibrant as brian and jake remembered her; however, it is the men\\'s careers that are the most problematic. she and jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to be involved in a serious relationship with her because she is not jewish, a fact which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and also with his mother (who disowned her eldest son - jake\\'s older brother ethan - for marrying outside the faith). between the religious conflict and their desire to spare the feelings of their mutual friend, the relationship is kept mostly secret, resulting in both humorous and harmful complications. as the months pass, both jake and anna\\'s feelings for each other become stronger but due to the aforementioned issues, jake still refuses the relationship as a serious one, despite anna dropping hints to him about her having been recently taking a class (but refusing to tell him what kind of class it is), and her becoming visibly upset when they run into members of jake\\'s congregation while on a date and jake introducing her only as \"my old friend anna\".\\r\\nmeanwhile, brian is involved in his own test of faith as he struggles with his feelings for anna despite his vows. apart from praying about the situation and discussing it with fr. havel, he keeps these thoughts mostly to himself. brian begins misinterpreting anna\\'s words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her. anna tells jake that she wants things to be more serious between them and he does not respond well. while the three have dinner one night with jake\\'s mother ruth, ruth has a private conversation with anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about anna and jake\\'s secret relationship. jake and brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later jake and anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration. anna calls brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment. still unaware of what\\'s been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him, then kisses her and admits his love. when she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with jake and finally admits that she and jake have been seeing each other secretly for months. feeling embarrassed and rejected, brian raids anna\\'s liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize. he leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets. the next day, still drunk, brian stumbles into jake\\'s temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi. he leaves and stumbles around the city, which brings the movie back to the very first scene with the bartender.\\r\\nas the community center\\'s grand opening approaches, along with the last days of anna\\'s east coast assignment, the relationships begin to mend, first with jake reconciling with brian, followed by anna reconciling with brian shortly after. a discussion between the two men prompts jake to go to anna\\'s office building, with brian shouting encouragement at him as he runs down the street. jake interrupts anna\\'s going away office party and manages to get her attention from a window in the building across the street and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right. later that evening, they surprise brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center, which looks to be off to a successful start. anna greets rabbi lewis (eli wallach) as he passes by and asks about their meetings together, referencing the class that anna had told jake briefly she had been taking, at which point it becomes clear that she had been taking classes to convert to judaism. she tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is also now staying in new york, with jake clearly thrilled. the film ends happily with the three childhood friends posing for a photo together.',\n",

seconds later, viv will enter. viv reluctantly agrees and takes the gun from monte.\\r\\nat 11:59, monte and lucy drop the champagne bottles and glasses... but viv doesn't show up. thinking she has dropped out, monte storms off, and lucy follows. she finds him in the freezer causing havoc and messing the room up. with adrenaline rushing through him, he makes out with lucy. as it turns out, viv had a flat tyre on her bike, so by the time she turns up in a disguise to commence the robbery the guests are calm and don't take her seriously. she makes threats but the guests laugh at her, so she pretends she's a performing artist and the stunt was part of her act.\\r\\nin the freezer, lucy flees the room, leaving monte confused. she tracks down vivian, who explains what happened. the situation is desperate and 12:30 looms, so viv fires the gun, exclaiming, 'sorry, i guess i wasn't kidding... money. now. all of it.' jeanette, who works at the register, can't understand vivian because the disguise is covering her face. annoyed, viv presses a button on her bra, which causes two knife-like spikes to stick out of it. jeanette is fascinated and happily hands over a bag of money. lucy and monte leave the restaurant and later all three of them can be seen throwing money into the air, celebrating.\\r\\nexpecting lucy to uphold her side of the deal, monte heads to the register office and waits for her. meanwhile, lucy heads back to the antique shop to buy the ring, only to find it has been sold. she heads over to viv's apartment to mope. viv's in a cheerful mood, however: since the robbery, companies have been calling her about her 'self-defence bra'. lucy doesn't share the enthusiasm. viv asks if she and monte tied the knot. lucy realises she completely forgot, so she and vivian rush to the register office.\\r\\nthe girls arrive and monte whisks lucy away, but they are not able to marry because she left her i.d. at viv's apartment. there is simply no time to get married any other day, so monte leaves in anger. the two girls leave, too, and lucy, full of guilt, confesses to vivian that she made out with monte. the two talk about him before deciding to head to a bar and get drunk.\\r\\nmonte, meanwhile, is at the restaurant when cecil and dante approach him. it is revealed that monte didn't need to get married to get his green card, but because he made a $2,000,000 bet with cecil and dante. we also learn that monte has a terrible gambling problem. he manages to convince them to give him another chance, and they make another bet: lucy will have one minute to escape from a straitjacket, hanging upside down, with her feet cuffed, inside a locked canvas bag, underwater (in cecil and dante's giant aquarium at the restaurant). if she is unable to, monte will owe them $4,000,000, or, he will undergo plastic surgery to make himself look like dante.\\r\\nof course, monte can't win without lucy's help. he arrives at lucy's apartment, where the two girls are asleep. he wakes them up and discovers they have serious hangovers. worried that they won't help him, monte makes up a story, 'cecil and dante know about the robbery... i don't know how they found out... there's still hope. i made a deal- a bet-a bet with cecil and dante: if we win, they drop all charges, like nothing ever happened...

              " 'following the screening of her latest film \"the scarlet lady\", hollywood movie star april tremaine is posing for photographs in chicago when her overly opinionated director, ivan ivansky, suddenly orders the newspaper reporters and photographers out of the room. once they are out, he tells her that her next film has to differ in tone to the previous ones, and april is horrified to know that, in order to accomplish this, he has decided she has to have a baby. her complaints fall on deaf ears to ivan, who charges his press agent, patsy riley, with the job of finding one for a publicity stunt. patsy\\'s first thought is to enlist the help of pennsylvania railroad locomotive driver maurice \"mike\" monaghan, an old boyfriend of hers and one of the regular drivers of the prr\\'s top-link express train, the broadway limited. mike is at first delighted when he hears that they are travelling on the limited, but is less enthused when he is assigned to try to find the baby required for the stunt. as he gloomily outlines the problem to the bartender of the engine shed cafe, an unknown man nearby overhears, and makes a telephone call before informing mike that he has solved his problem. mike is so glad to see his dilemma solved that he vows to remain his lifelong friend - but unknown to him, the kidnapping of a baby belonging to family named pierson has made headline news.\\r\\nat chicago union station, april\\'s adopted baby attracts a great deal of attention from news reporters. they are watched as they board the broadway limited by a suspicious-looking stranger, who hands over some money to the man who helped mike out of his predicament earlier before boarding the express himself. mike has been rostered to the first leg of the journey from chicago to fort wayne, where another crew is waiting to take the train on to harrisburg. as they make their way along the line, he informs his fireman that he is taking his holiday in new york, and won\\'t be returning to chicago with him. the fireman is rather taken aback when he hears that mike is travelling on the limited, especially when he mentions that patsy is on the train.\\r\\nmeanwhile, patsy is met by myra prottle, the president of the chicago april tremaine club. patsy is just showing her into ivan\\'s compartment when she is called away, and when ivan eventually emerges, he doesn\\'t immediately recognise miss prottle and firmly orders her out. she re-enters shortly after on patsy\\'s prompting, but this time she is on hand to explain who exactly miss prottle is to ivan before he can get rid of her again, whereupon ivan takes out his annoyance on her at his own mistake and orders her to leave him and miss prottle in peace. in her own compartment, april is having trouble with the baby again, but isn\\'t sure how to stop him crying. thinking that he may be hungry, she leaves him in patsy\\'s care and goes to the buffet in the observation lounge, where she unexpectedly meets up with her childhood sweetheart, dr harvey north, who remembers her by her real name of mary potter. their brief gossip is interrupted when patsy reminds april about the baby; harvey, who is especially gifted with children, follows to see if he can help. when they get back to april\\'s compartment, she confides in patsy that ivan may have a point in what he had said on their way to the station, about being at home, nurturing her very own child - and a young husband. realising that she is thinking of marrying harvey, patsy rushes back to ivan\\'s compartment to break the news to him. meanwhile, harvey is rather taken aback by the baby\\'s similar appearance to april\\'s, almost as if he were her own. april tries to explain that it is merely a publicity stunt, but harvey cannot bring himself to believe this, and when she asks for ivan\\'s support, unaware that he is fearful of losing his leading lady, he denies that he had anything to do with it. displeased at being fooled, harvey walks out and returns to the observation saloon, and an angry april forces ivan and patsy out of her compartment along with the baby.\\r\\nat fort wayne, mike hands his engine, k4 no. 3763, over to the relief crew and joins the train itself. while he is waiting in the dining car for patsy, he is briefly harassed by a small boy before being joined at his table by harvey. patsy enters the dining car a little later with april and miss prottle. seeing harvey at mike\\'s table, april tries once again to reason with him, but harvey still doesn\\'t believe her. in the end she gets her way by telling him that ivan was the father. ivan soon approaches her table with the baby, and is confused when harvey threatens to knock his teeth down his throat before storming off, but april smugly repeats to ivan what she had said to harvey. horrified, ivan leaves the baby with april and flees to his compartment to pack his suitcase, ordering the train porter to stop the train and let him off in spite of it being scheduled to run straight through to harrisburg. the porter has only just gone to talk to the guard about it when harvey comes to interrogate ivan. before he can do so, ivan reveals to him that it was indeed a mere publicity stunt, leaving harvey rather ashamed of himself.\\r\\nin the dining car, mike has joined patsy and miss prottle on their table and is explaining to miss prottle about various aspects of railroading. he has just finished explaining how he once avoided crashing into a derailed wagon when a goods train flashes past, causing mike to leap from his seat and yell a greeting. he explains to patsy and miss prottle that a friend/relative was driving the goods engine. eventually, patsy and miss prottle head off to help april with the baby, but before she leaves, patsy and mike agree to meet in the observation car later on. in the observation car, mike is just leafing through a newspaper when another passenger comments about the pierson kidnapping, which is still making headline news. he adds that the last such crime was foiled in just three weeks, the kidnapper being sentenced to death while the accomplice, who didn\\'t realise that the kid had been taken hostage in the first place, was given 177 years - effectively a life sentence. mike is shocked when he reads that the baby in question is similar in appearance to the one lent to april tremaine, and was believed to have been heading east. when he sees that the other passenger is a detective, he hastily leaves the saloon and heads for patsy\\'s compartment to check the baby for the one detail that hasn\\'t been seen yet; a mole on his left shoulder.\\r\\nby this time, patsy and miss prottle have the baby ready for bed, but miss prottle insists on staying up late to listen to \"renfrew of the mounted\", a radio series of which she is a big fan. mike hastily offers to look after the baby briefly while they go and listen to the latest installment on the observation saloon radio. as soon as they have gone, the suspicious character looks through the door and remarks to mike about the baby, adding that he will be right outside if he needs any help. he shuts the door behind him, and mike pulls the baby\\'s shirt down to look at his shoulder. sure enough, he sees a dark patch similar to a mole.\\r\\nin the observation saloon, \"renfrew of the mounted\" is just finishing when mike comes in and tries to explain their dilemma to patsy while miss prottle takes charge of the baby, but patsy is so annoyed at his anxious rambling that she mistakes it for lack of interest in her, and accordingly walks out on him. realising that he is on his own, mike reacts by collecting every newspaper in the train before discarding them through the carriage window. in the observation saloon, meanwhile, harvey tries to apologise to april for his misunderstanding, but april refuses to hear him out. ivan, who had opted to stay on the train after all, steps in and reminds harvey that he is a mere, underpaid doctor, and advises that he shouldn\\'t interfere with her career any longer. although suspicious that ivan may have ulterior motives, harvey reluctantly agrees; however, his guilt quickly catches up with him again, and his attempts to make up with april are constantly foiled by ivan staring warily out of his compartment. ironically, every time he himself tries to talk with april, harvey catches him out. this goes on until they catch mike leaving april\\'s compartment. both are taken aback by this, unaware that mike was really helping to open april\\'s suitcase.\\r\\nlater that night, patsy is woken by a sleepless mike, who tells her that, unbeknown to him until too late, the baby had been kidnapped. thankfully, patsy has a plan, and puts mike in charge of the baby until they get a chance to drop him off at a station. mike takes the baby back to his compartment and keeps him occupied by telling him \"the three bears\" until he falls asleep mid-story. shortly, patsy comes and informs him that the train has made an unscheduled stop. mike takes this opportunity to leave the baby in the booking office of the nearby station, but just as he leaves the building, the suspicious man finds the baby with a note in his crib: \"please return to chicago; notify police\". he screws up the note and surreptitiously returns the baby to april\\'s compartment. when mike returns, he finds that the train is being held up for two and a half hours; there is a flood in the valley, and the express engine has been commandeered to take a consignment of coal trucks to the town affected by the flood. the other engine, a d16, is unable to make it fast enough. mike suggests that they use the smaller engine to pull the broadway limited, but the driver and fireman are sceptical, saying that they \"couldn\\'t get enough head on that to haul the limited around the block\". mike however is insistent, and challenges the superintendent, mulcany, into firing the engine for him. with that, mike and mulcany prepare the d16 while no. 3673 is shunted onto the coal trucks. the d16 slips violently at first, but with careful handling and some sand on the rails, mike manages to get the express rolling again.\\r\\nback on the train, miss prottle realises that the baby is missing and frantically tells ivan, who orders the guard to call for the police. patsy overhears and rushes miss prottle back to bed before repeating to ivan what mike had told her. realising that they are headed for prison cells if the police are sent for, ivan rushes off to order the guard not to send off the message, only to find he is too late. but almost immediately after he finds this out, he remembers that the baby is missing anyway, so they have no need to worry.\\r\\nmeanwhile, april is woken up to find the baby on her bedside table. although confused at first as to how the baby got into her compartment and why he is wide awake, she sees a chance to make up her dispute with harvey, and asks the porter to send for him. when harvey arrives, he deduces that the baby just isn\\'t tired, much to april\\'s relief, but kindly offers to stay and keep an eye on him. by this time april is beginning to realise just how right ivan was about babies, and expresses to harvey a desire to have one of her own. ivan\\'s words are still playing on harvey\\'s mind, however, and he is therefore rather pessimistic about this until april tells him that she has had enough of making films with ivan. they both head off to ivan\\'s compartment, where april confesses her love to harvey, and the two of them share a kiss just as ivan opens his door. ivan is horrified, not only because harvey went back on his word, but also at april\\'s intention to quit from hollywood and marry harvey. they leave ivan pacing back and forth in his compartment, ranting and raving to himself in russian as he tries desperately to work out a way round it.\\r\\nby dawn, ivan is still pacing in his compartment, unable to sleep, when he hits on a compromise whereby (he hopes) everyone will win. excited, he heads off to harvey\\'s compartment and, admitting that he has been rather heartless up till now, proposes to build harvey\\'s life-ambition - \"the finest clinic that science can dream up/money can buy\". harvey is unconvinced at first, but ivan promises to pay him the required $50,000 and give him a contract before he leaves the train. while they are discussing this, the express enters harrisburg, where it is to change engines and proceed to new york behind a gg1 electric locomotive. as soon as they have stopped, mulcany congratulates mike on his expert handling of the little d16 and wishes him a nice holiday. mike returns to the train feeling pleased with himself, unaware that the police have begun to search the limited for the baby. following a brief visit from one of the policemen, ivan confides in harvey about their predicament, and is shocked to hear from harvey that the baby is still aboard the train. he runs back to april\\'s compartment, where april is just dressing the baby for the day, and explains to her how he had been kidnapped. patsy enters shortly after, and is shocked to find the baby on april\\'s bed. ivan hands her the baby and forces her into her own compartment before hastily organising a ruse with april; as soon as the policeman enters, april pretends to be distraught while ivan keeps him occupied for a short while.\\r\\nback in patsy\\'s compartment, mike comes to inform patsy that everything is under control - but patsy reveals that the baby is back aboard the train, much to his bewilderment. he takes the baby back into april\\'s compartment just in time to avoid being caught out by miss prottle and the policeman, whom miss prottle mistakes for \"renfrew of the mounted\".\\r\\nthe policemen soon come to the conclusion that the baby isn\\'t on the train, and head back to make their report. with the coast clear and the engines changed, mike heads to his compartment with the baby while ivan, patsy, april and harvey try to find a way out of their crisis. ivan suggests that they get off at philadelphia, but patsy reminds him that they will be rounded up by the police even if they don\\'t stay on the train until new york. at philadelphia, the suspicious man is met by another two men, who join the train for the last few miles to new york. back in april\\'s compartment, patsy, harvey, april and ivan are still desperately trying to find a solution to their problem - until miss prottle points out that they are all heroes. harvey and april realise that they needn\\'t have worried about the baby after all; they just have to hand him to the police, and they will be on the front page of every newspaper in the usa. at that moment, mike comes in and announces that he is going to surrender as soon as they reach new york, to which all eagerly agree. patsy sends him to get the baby, and mike, elated when he hears that they will all be received to a hero\\'s welcome, instantly obliges. shortly after, the guard hands ivan the contract and a $50,000 cheque for the clinic. harvey is just signing the contract when mike bursts back into the room in a panic, saying that the baby has gone. all six of them spread out to look for the baby, whom mike eventually finds with the suspicious stranger. he approaches him, demanding the baby back, but the other two passengers try to restrain him. mike, however, is too strong for them, and knocks them down before hanging the suspicious passenger on the coat-hanger. patsy enters and is about to take the baby when the other two passengers come round and bar her way, only to be overpowered once again by mike.\\r\\non arrival at pennsylvania station, it is revealed that the pierson baby had been found the night before, and that the suspicious-looking man was actually the baby\\'s father; he had let them use the baby for the publicity stunt on the basis that he could use the $500 reward for a family reunion. the other two characters, he adds, are his brother and brother-in-law from philadelphia. mike points out what he believes is a mole on the baby\\'s shoulder, but it turns out to be a false beauty mark that miss prottle had lost. with their misunderstanding sorted out, patsy heads off to niagara falls with mike while the flustered father leaves for his reunion. before harvey and april leave, however, they read through the contract and find that the clinic is to be located right across the street from ivan\\'s studio, possibly indicating that ivan intended to keep april as his leading lady without interfering too much with her private life with harvey. as for miss prottle, she chases after another policeman, once again believing him to be renfrew.',\n",

the freshman). the mild-mannered harold is quickly offered a job by the pompous advertising tycoon j.e. waggleberry (raymond walburn). after completing his college studies a few months later, harold meets with mr. waggleberry at his advertising office for the job offer. although harold dreams of becoming an \"ideas man,\" waggleberry assigns him to a lowly position in the bookkeeping department.\\r\\njumping forward 22 years later to the year 1945, the now middle-aged harold, who has been stuck in his dull, dead-end book-keeping job, is let go by waggleberry for incompetency and lack of ambition. he is given an 18 karat swiss watch that is \\'properly inscribed \"with gratitude and love and kisses for 20 years devoted services\"\\' and a check for $2,946.12, the remains of his company investment plan. he bids farewell to miss otis (frances ramsden), a young woman who works at an artist\\'s desk down the aisle, giving her the paid-for engagement ring that he had, having planned to marry each of her six older sisters (hortense, irma, harriet, margie, claire, and rosemary) when they had worked there before her. he wanders out, aimlessly through the streets, his life\\'s savings in his trouser pocket.\\r\\nwhile looking through the newspaper want ads for another job, harold is approached by wormy (jimmy conlin), a local con artist, petty gambler, and racetrack tout, who asks harold for some money so he can place a bet. seeing the large amount of cash that harold has, and hoping to get him drunk enough to acquire some of the cash, wormy takes the depressed and unemployed harold to a local bar for a drink. when harold tells the bartender, jake (edgar kennedy), that he has never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \"the diddlebock\", one sip of which is enough to release harold from all his inhibitions. the effects of the alcohol causes harold to yowl uncontrollably. gazing at himself in the bar mirror, harold suddenly declares himself a loser and races out to remake himself. soon harold is getting his hair cut and his nails manicured at a local tailor shop and salon, and is trying on a gaudy plaid suit supplied by tailor formfit franklin (franklin pangborn). in the midst of his transformation, harold overhears wormy talking with his bookie max (lionel stander), and impulsively bets $1,000 of his money on a 15-to-one long shot horse named emmaline. to everyone\\'s surprise, emmaline wins, and the now-rich harold, with $15,000 in his pockets, begins to celebrate all around town on a day-and-a-half binge of spending, gambling, and carousing.\\r\\na few days later, harold wakes up on the sofa inside the house of his widowed sister flora (margaret hamilton) where she chastises him for his wild, irresponsible behavior. he finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe and a ten-gallon cowboy hat. unable to remember much about his drunken binge, particularly about what he did on wednesday which is a total blank, harold wanders outside to return the plaid suit where he is surprised to learn that he now owns a hansom horse-drawn cab complete with an english driver named thomas (robert greig). a worried wormy then rushes up and informs harold that, with winnings from a second bet, harold also bought a bankrupt circus. after a meeting with the animal handlers and circus freaks, harold first seeks help from the kitt-poo home for cats to feed the circus\\' starving lions and tigers. seeing no future with the ownership of the circus, harold then gets the idea to sell the circus to a wall street banker.\\r\\nharold and wormy visit the circus-loving wall street banker lynn sargent (rudy vallee) to ask him to purchase their circus, but he turns them down because he is trying to unload his own bankrupt circus. when the rest of the town\\'s bankers follow suit, harold comes up with an idea. to get past the bank guards, harold dresses up in his plaid suit and brings along jackie, a tame circus lion, who incites panic. carrying a filled thermos, wormy gives shot drinks of the potent \"diddlebock\" cocktail to each of the bankers they visit so their inhibitions will fade and convince them to put in bids for ownership of the circus. things take a turn for the worse when the lion gets loose, in which harold, wormy, and the lion end up on the ledge of a skyscraper, but narrowly avoid plunging to certain death.\\r\\naccording to harold\\'s plan, the three (harold, wormy, and jackie the lion) are arrested and thrown in jail. miss otis bails them out the following day, and they find that the publicity has attracted a mob of bankers at the jail who want to buy the circus – but ringling brothers outbids them. harold celebrates with another \"diddlebock\", and again has another relapse. in the final scene, harold wakes up another day or two later in the horse-drawn cab with miss otis where he learns that he received $175,000 for the sale of the circus, he is now an executive at waggleberry\\'s advertising agency, and that he and miss otis are married. reassuring harold that she truly loves him, miss otis gives him a big kiss, and harold finally remembers what he was doing all day on wednesday. the final shot shows wormy tagging along with them by riding on the back bumper of the cab.[3][4]',\n",
              " 'in 1942, a few months after america\\'s entry into world war ii, secretary ruth wood (jane wyman) lives quietly in manhattan with her physically and emotionally fragile mother, agnes (josephine hutchinson). ruth\\'s co-workers at excelsior shoe manufacturing company are her best friend grace ullman (eileen heckart) and millie kranz (peggie castle), an attractive blonde involved in an affair with her married boss, stephen jalonik (fred clark). also in the office is monty (arte johnson), a young shipping clerk classified by the draft as 4-f, who monitors the war\\'s campaigns on a world map pinned to the wall.\\r\\none evening after work, when a cloudburst forces ruth and other pedestrians to take shelter in the vestibule of an office building, arthur hugenon (van johnson), a cheerful, talkative g.i. stationed in the area, surprises the shy ruth by starting a conversation. when he invites her to dinner, she declines, saying that her housebound mother is expecting her. undeterred, art buys food for three at a delicatessen and accompanies ruth home. agnes, who has distrusted men since her husband harry left her for another woman ten years earlier, receives art with little enthusiasm. during the meal, art, who grew up on a tennessee farm, captivates ruth with his stories and afterward entertains them by playing harry\\'s piano. upon finding the manuscript of an unfinished melody harry composed, art asks permission to take it back to camp, where he and his army buddy dixie will write lyrics for it. when weekend arrives, art takes ruth and grace to a matinee and, as they afterwards walk to a restaurant, passing an auction, ruth impulsively bids on an antique roman coin, which she gives to art for good luck. while the trio is enjoying dinner at the café normandy, ruth is unaware that the piano player is her father (william gargan), whom she has not seen since he left agnes. however, harry recognizes ruth and confides to his bartender friend andy that he has been too ashamed to return to his family.\\r\\nlater, ruth tells art that agnes tried to kill herself after harry left and still hopes for his return. art arrives late for their next sunday date, but brings the lyrics he and dixie have written to harry\\'s music, entitled \"i\\'ll always believe in you\", which he sings together with ruth. as they go out and walk through central park, ruth voices fears about the war and art tells her she must have faith. they then encounter sergeant gil parker (alan king), while he takes snapshots of his new bride, arlene witchy (barbara nichols), who works as a singer. gil asks art to take their picture and then offers to photograph art and ruth. in private, gil warns art that his division will soon be shipped overseas, but art refuses to believe the rumor. at the lagoon, where children are sailing toy boats, art recognizes the name of an elderly man, commodore eli b. windgate (halliwell hobbes), nicknamed \"windy\", a former yachtsman who owned many of the surrounding buildings before losing his fortune in the crash of \\'29. hoping to be a reporter after the war, art senses a good story and interviews windy on the spot. he then goes with ruth to the new york times building and convinces the city editor (unbilled grandon rhodes) to let him write it as a human interest story. instead of taking payment, art asks to be considered for a reporting job after the war. a couple of days later, as ruth waits to meet him for their pre-arranged date, art arrives late, riding on a truck filled with other soldiers, including dixie (unbilled paul smith). with only a brief moment remaining before the truck\\'s departure for the port where the troop ship awaits, he asks ruth to marry him when he returns and, to allay her fears, says he still has the lucky roman coin.\\r\\nfor three months, ruth writes to art every day, but receives no letters in return. finally, a special delivery man knocks on the apartment door and hands a letter from a battlefield chaplain informing her that art died in combat and that his dying wish was that she be told about his love for her. ruth\\'s tear drops on the letter and, in the following days and weeks, she is inconsolable despite the best efforts of her friends and co-workers. millie, moved by ruth\\'s misfortune, feels the need for a fresh and pure start, drops jalonik as her lover and leaves the firm. grace finds ruth consumed by grief, sitting on a bench in central park, and takes her to st. patrick\\'s cathedral, where ruth lights candles under the statue of saint andrew. jalonik, hoping ruth will fill the void left in his extra-marital life by millie, takes her to café normandy and attempts to engage in a warm-up conversation, but ruth is in such a despairing state that she pays no attention as he kisses her on the cheek. a few feet to the side, at the bar, harry has the radio on and hears the familiar strains of his music since, before shipping out, dixie made suggestions to art as to the possibility of marketing harry\\'s music with art\\'s lyrics as a professional song. puzzled, harry dials agnes\\' number but, at the sound of her voice, his resolve falters and he hangs up without speaking. having written numerous letters of explanation and contrition to agnes, he continually found himself tearing them to bits, because of inability to face the hurt he caused her.\\r\\nruth has been returning to the statue of st. andrew and talking to the cathedral\\'s young priest (paul picerni). losing interest in life, she ignores a cold, which turns into pneumonia. mrs. hamer, the upstairs neighbor who has often helped ruth care for agnes, now helps agnes nurse the bedridden ruth. one rainy night, while agnes has dozed off near her bedside, the feverish ruth leaves the apartment just before harry finally musters the courage to walk in with the intention of asking agnes\\' forgiveness for leaving. stunned at seeing him, agnes also realizes that ruth is missing, just as grace telephones. upon being told that ruth has left her sickbed, grace realizes that she must be heading for the cathedral.\\r\\nstanding on the cathedral steps, consumed by fever, ruth hears art\\'s voice speaking her name. delirious, she sees art materialize and slowly approach close enough for an embrace or a kiss as he tells her that love never dies. no longer possessing earthly means of holding on to the roman coin she gifted to him, art returns it to ruth. a moment later, in the midst of the heavy, late evening rain, the priest finds ruth unconscious on the steps, just as grace arrives. seeing the coin clasped in ruth\\'s hand, he shows it to grace, who recognizes it and realizes that, for a brief moment, art had returned to ruth, whose own tenuous hold on life remains clouded in uncertainty at the final fadeout.',\n",

              " 'the film starts on ocean drive in miami, florida. a flash mob, later identified as \"the mob\", shuts down ocean drive briefly by cutting off the streets with retro convertibles and dancing on cars to music blasted by dj penelope (cleopatra coleman). a few hours later, sean asa (ryan guzman), eddy (misha gabriel), and jason hardlerson (stephen \"twitch\" boss), the leaders of the mob, watch their latest flashmob air on the television news in a restaurant kitchen of the dimont hotel where they work as waiters. a few complain about their public disturbance, while others praise it. after they get off work, they sneak into the hotel\\'s beach club, claiming to be guests, not employees.\\r\\nmeanwhile, across the club at the bar, emily anderson (kathryn mccormick) tries to get the bartender\\'s attention, but ends up preparing her own beer. sean, who is immediately smitten by her, asks for a beer. she tells him it\\'s on the house, then heads down to the beach to dance, resulting in a dance battle between the two, but ending with emily suddenly running off when she sees one of her dad\\'s business partners, trip.\\r\\nthe next day, emily and her father william \"bill\" anderson (peter gallagher) argue over breakfast at the dimont hotel. sean, their waiter, immediately recognizes her, but emily spills her orange juice in an attempt to distract sean. he helps clean it up, but when he goes too far emily immediately storms off in an angry fit with sean following her into the hotel\\'s ballroom, where emily begins a fast contemporary dance, oblivious to sean\\'s presence. after emily notices sean and warms up to him, she explains to him that she\\'s trying to nail an audition for the prestigious winwood dance academy company, which she is already a pupil of. sean advises her to incorporate faster, more interesting moves, but emily declines, saying that there are rules. sean, in turn, tells her to break the rules, giving her an address and telling her to come there. emily does and finds herself at the miami museum of fine arts, where the paintings and statues come to life, which is work of the mob. by telling her to attend, sean basically reveals to her his participation in the mob.\\r\\nthe next day, emily persuades sean to let her take part in their next mob, which is scheduled to hit a restaurant the following week. eddy immediately dislikes emily, giving her the lead to test her. sean then introduces her to \"the gang\" where she meets eddy (the hacker), penelope (the dj), jason hardlerson (the fx), and mercury (the artist), who never talks. he also explains that they are trying to win a contest through youtube by getting 10 million hits on the site. the flashmob goes well and eddy admits that emily did great. they then celebrate at ricky\\'s, where sean and emily salsa together, much to everyone\\'s delight. sean and emily then sneak onto a boat sean had reserved for himself to sail down the river. there, they bond over their mothers both not being a part of their lives, and they kiss and sleep on the boat until morning. when they hurry back to ricky\\'s, which turns out to be owned by sean\\'s uncle ricky, ricky reveals to them that emily\\'s dad, a building tycoon, is planning to develop the strip, destroying ricky\\'s bar, sean\\'s home, sean\\'s sister\\'s home and workplace, and many other things. enraged, emily storms off to talk to her dad, with sean following behind her. emily wants to tell the mob who her dad is, but is reluctantly convinced by sean not to. she instead finds out from her dad that there will be a meeting to determine whether the project to develop the strip goes through or not. she convinces the rest of the mob to protest the plans. their dance is a huge hit, gaining the group over a million more views.\\r\\neddy finds out that emily is william\\'s daughter through watching a tape of sean and emily rehearsing where she reveals the truth, without knowing that they are being recorded. enraged, he reveals with the mob to william through a protest dance that emily is a part of the mob. this ruins relationships for emily with sean (romantically), eddy (friendly), william (trustfully), and the rest of the mob. emily leaves embarrassed, and sean, brokenhearted, is arrested for trying to stop eddy from being arrested after they fight. emily had rehearsed her winwood audition piece as a duet with sean, but now that she and sean are estranged, she no longer has him as a dance partner. instead, she adapts the piece, dancing it as a solo performance. the result falls flat and she fails her audition for the troop. she finally meets sean, and tells him she is going back to work for her dad, per a promise she made with her dad that if she did not become a professional dancer by the end of the summer that she would work at his hotel.\\r\\nafter sean and eddy were sent to jail for being caught in the flashmob, ricky bails them out and sean and eddy make up. sean convinces the mob to do one last protest to speak for the people who don\\'t have a voice, but the mob gives them one. they then mob the development public announcement, with the help of past step up characters, including moose (adam sevani), vladd and jenny kido. sean and emily then perform the original audition piece. seeing his daughter so happy, william decides to build up the community rather than tear it down, and he and emily reconcile. sean and emily kiss passionately and make up, and sean and eddy make a deal with the owner of the marketing firm that represents nike for the mob to dance in their commercials.',\n",
              " 'in the upper peninsula of michigan, small-town lawyer paul biegler (stewart), a former district attorney who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano, and hanging out with his alcoholic friend and colleague parnell mccarthy (o\\'connell) and sardonic secretary maida rutledge (arden).\\r\\none day, biegler is contacted by laura manion (remick), to defend her husband us army lieutenant frederick \"manny\" manion (gazzara), who has been arrested for the first-degree murder of innkeeper bernard \"barney\" quill. manion does not deny the murder, but claims that quill raped his wife. even with such a motivation, getting manion cleared of murder would be difficult, but manion claims to have no memory of the event, suggesting that he may be eligible for a defense of irresistible impulse—a version of a temporary insanity defense. biegler\\'s folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hide a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that has the judge busy keeping things under control. however, the case for the defense does not go well, especially since the local district attorney (brooks west) is assisted by high-powered prosecutor claude dancer (scott) from the attorney general\\'s office.\\r\\nfurthermore, the prosecution tries at every instance to block any mention of manion\\'s motive for killing quill. biegler eventually manages to get the rape of laura manion into the record and judge weaver (joseph n. welch) agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. during cross-examination, dancer insinuates that laura openly flirted with other men, including the man she claimed raped her. psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to manion\\'s state of mind at the time that he killed quill. dancer says that manion may have suspected laura of cheating on him because he asked his wife, a catholic, to swear on a rosary that quill raped her. this raises doubt as to whether the act was non-consensual.\\r\\nquill\\'s estate is to be inherited by mary pilant (kathryn grant), whom dancer accuses of being quill\\'s mistress. mccarthy learns that she is in fact quill\\'s daughter, a fact she is anxious to keep secret since she was born out of wedlock. biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade pilant that al paquette (murray hamilton), the bartender who witnessed the murder, may know if quill admitted to him of raping laura but paquette is covering this up, either because he loves pilant or out of loyalty to quill. through pilant, biegler is unable to get paquette to testify on behalf of manion.\\r\\nduring the trial, laura claims that quill tore off her panties while raping her; the panties were not found where she alleges the rape took place. pilant, unaware of any details of the case, testifies that she found the panties in the inn\\'s laundry room. biegler suggests quill may have attempted to avoid suspicion by dropping the panties down the laundry chute, located next to his room, to avoid suspicion. dancer tries to establish that pilant\\'s answers are founded on her jealousy. when dancer asserts forcibly that quill was pilant\\'s lover and that pilant lied to cover this fact, pilant shocks everyone by stating that quill was her father. manion is found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\". after the trial, biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober mccarthy as his partner.\\r\\nthe next day, biegler and mccarthy travel to the manions\\' trailer park home to get manion\\'s signature on a promissory note which they hope will suffice as collateral for a desperately needed loan. it turns out the manions have vacated the trailer park, the trailer park superintendent commenting that laura manion had been crying. manion left a note for biegler, indicating that his flight was \"an irresistible impulse\", the same justification biegler used during the trial. biegler states that mary pilant has retained him to execute quill\\'s estate; mccarthy says that working for her will be \"poetic justice\".']"

observes the young blond from the previous scene and stops to speak with her and offer a meal and a place to stay. in the course of discussion between the young woman and ruby, it is made clear that

which the murder victim, action jackson, seen in the opening scene, was originally assigned to. ruby confers with candy cane and he ends up inviting her to go along with him to communist cuba. once in cuba, ruby meets with vitali and they meet with the elderly and imprisoned sicilian mobster santos alicante, who has been in jail in cuba since the 1959 communist takeover after his casino hotel was closed down. vitali tells ruby that they are to spring santos from cuba to put him back in place in the usa as part of a complex operation plan. however, after their visit, vitali accompanies ruby back to his and candy’s hotel room where he secretly tells him the real reason for this assignment; he wants ruby to kill santos because the people that vitali works for feel that santos has outgrown his usefulness to them. vitali gives ruby an 8\\xa0mm film camera that has a pistol encased in it to carry out the killing. but that evening, ruby instead kills vitali on the dock near the prison and springs santos from his cell by bribing the guards, and then he, santos, and candy flee cuba aboard vitali’s boat back to america. after arriving in new orleans, ruby makes contact with david ferrie, an old friend from his days in chicago, to supply him with the necessary papers enabling santos to re-enter the country. shortly after, ruby and candy return to dallas, while santos goes off on his own.\\r\\nseveral months later, ruby, still managing the carousel club in which candy is now the star attraction, has an encounter one evening when candy’s estranged and abusive husband, hank, shows up and confronts her after the show in her apartment, wanting her to return to him. ruby beats up candy/sheryl ann’s husband and warns him never to come back to the club.\\r\\nthe next day, a mysterious man, identifying himself only by his name of \\'maxwell\\', pays a visit to ruby at the currently closed club to talk with him about the killing of vitali and of the release of santos from cuba. with a clearly implied threat of arrest and incarceration, maxwell wants ruby to redeem himself to the people that maxwell works for by being an informant for him on santos, who has since opened up a new hotel and casino in las vegas since his return to the united states as well as santos’ affiliates. maxwell supplies ruby with a mini-tape recorder to assist, and ruby makes the assumption that maxwell works for the cia, which maxwell neither denies or admits.\\r\\nruby and candy travel to las vegas and check into santos’ new hotel, where a gala event is taking place that involves a stage performance by singer tony montana. ruby is also suspicious when a helicopter arrives and drops off the president of the united states, john f. kennedy, who is attending the event. candy attends the event with david ferrie, who sits with her at the table where the president is sitting, while ruby sits with santos and several like-minded people who are clearly connected to organized crime. recording the conversation, the men want ruby to smuggle into cuba “special cigars” for fidel castro to assassinate him for the loss of all their casinos and business since the 1959 takeover. when ruby excuses himself to go outside, he meets with maxwell in the hotel parking lot, where he drives ruby outside the city and reveals another assignment for him to partake in the assassination of a prominent official, implying it to be castro.\\r\\nthe next day, candy tells ruby that the people that santos works with want her to stay in las vegas to perform as a singer in their hotels, thanks to some presidential connections that she managed to get hold of. ruby returns to dallas alone, while he makes use of free time by shooting at watermelons and other targets from a distance in preparation for his next assassination assignment.\\r\\nsometime later, ruby talks with lenny, an old friend of his, about assignments for cia associates and lenny tells ruby that to take out a \"target\" relies on two or more rifle marksmen and a \"patsy\" or \"fall guy\" to be caught in order to place all the blame for the crime to divert suspicion away from the investigating authorities.\\r\\nmeanwhile, diego the bartender meets with david ferrie where they travel to new orleans where they make contact with lee harvey oswald, whom they ask to talk about going in on a job.\\r\\nback in dallas, ruby meets with santos, sam giaccana, and their men at another meeting where giaccana tells ruby that his assignment to take out castro has been canceled because another matter has come up. giaccana tells ruby that the cia has been having troubles with president kennedy over the cuba issue and wanting to reveal the cia’s true nature. after ruby leaves, giaccana meets with maxwell for a talk.\\r\\nreturning to his club, ruby sees candy there, who tells him that she quit her career tour which included performances for the president because she felt they were taking advantage of her and her charms. it is implied that candy had shared some intimate time with kennedy and possibly others. while ruby and candy decide to revise the club with a new classy act as a singing club, he begins to figure out what maxwell and the mob associates are doing: planning a high-level assassination. ruby tells his boss, proby, that from his views and experiences in the past several months, the cia and the mafia work together to stage and carry out contract killings, and get away with it by subcontracting third parties to carry out the work. proby has some doubts, but he tells ruby to leave the matter alone for he cannot blow the lid on a complex conspiracy such as this.\\r\\non november 22, 1963, jfk arrives in dallas where maxwell meets with oswald, diego, and two other henchmen, where he tells them their assignments. while ruby is at a newspaper office to file a new listing for his club, candy is watching the president’s limo convoy ride through the city. it is shown that diego, with oswald as the handler, shoots kennedy from the sixth-floor window of the dallas book depository, while the second assassin, and his handler, fire the fatal shot, killing kennedy from the grassy knoll section near the building to the building.\\r\\nafter watching the events on a tv set, a distraught ruby returns to his club, where proby is rummaging through his desk to look for the audio tape of the recording of the conversation ruby had in las vegas with santos and his associates, but the tape is gone. ruby tells proby, who has not heard about the assassination, that their enemies have won. the following day, david ferrie pays a visit to ruby at the club where they watch a tv broadcast about the arrest of lee harvey oswald and that he also was arrested for killing officer tippit, a regular customer at the club. ferrie tells ruby to forget that they ever met and that he shouldn’t do anything stupid for he calls ruby only a \"small time hood\". ruby vows he will make the world understand.\\r\\nthe next day, ruby goes to the dallas county jail where oswald is being transferred and kills him. ruby is immediately arrested by the police—just as he wanted them to. in jail, ruby

an all-female motorcycle gang called the maneaters. the maneaters hang out in an abandoned house and hold weekly motorcycle races at an abandoned airport runway. the leader of the maneaters, the tough-minded queen (betty connell), holds the races and the winner of each race gets first pick from the \"stud line\".\\r\\nthe race begins and karen is the winner, with queen coming in second. nevertheless, queen is a good sport and allows karen to pick first. on this particular day, queen and the rest of the maneaters return to their hideout where a group of young men have also arrived, whom are male groupies to the all-women gang. karen picks out her usual \"stud\", a friendly guy named bill... the same one she has picked for four weeks in a row. however, this is strictly forbidden among the maneaters for according to their code, no maneater is allowed to be attached to anyone or anything but the gang. one of the fastest held rules of the group is that \"all men are mothers\" and no maneater falls in love.\\r\\nhoney pot, a teenage \"mascot\" and follower of the maneaters who wants to join, reports to queen her suspicions about karen\\'s attraction to bill. after debating about it with her fellow members, queen tells honey pot to inform karen that she is to come to the runway that evening. when karen shows up as expected, queen and the rest of the gang angrily decrees to her a punishing ultimatum, karen is to participate in the beating then dragging of bill for face expulsion of the gang. karen gets on her motorcycle and is forced to drag bill, who is tied, beaten, and bruised behind her down the entire stretch of the runway and back. bill is dead after this, and karen\\'s allegiance and loyalty to the gang is proven.\\r\\nanother evening later, honey pot is finally granted membership into the gang. in a hazing ritual, honey pot has her left hand cut open in a blood oath and made to kiss all the members of the gang to prove her sisterhood. next, honey pot is stripped to her underwear and doused in honey and chocolate syrup and made to entertain the entire \"stud line\". following this, honey pot is cleaned off, is given a leather jacket with the maneaters logo stamped on the back like the rest of the members and is formally initiated into the gang.\\r\\nthe next day, the gang rides into the small florida town of medley and terrorizes and harasses the locals by riding their motorcycles through parking lots, through storefronts, and around the front and back lawns of houses. when their antics are stopped by the local police, the townspeople (out of fear of retaliation) refuse to press charges. as a result, the police make no successful arrests. unable to pin anything on the maneaters, the police are forced to let them go, only giving queen and the rest of the maneaters a warning to stay out of trouble.\\r\\nanother week later, the stud line competition is again on, and queen and the rest of the maneaters head off to the runway for another motorcycle race only to discover that an all-male gang are hanging out along the runway. what was supposed to be a fun-spirited race turns into an all-out brawl. queen and the

victorious.\\r\\nted (rodney bedell), an old boyfriend of karen\\'s, manages to track her down and privately beseeches her to leave the maneaters and return to normal life, either with or without him. karen waivers, pleading the she is in too deep with the gang for any redemption and that he should forget about her. refusing to give up on karen, ted infiltrates the \"stud line\" posing as one of the ruffians. after the race, where queen emerges victorious, she gets first pick, but chooses another guy... unaware about ted\\'s identity, which karen recognizes. karen picks ted and they go to chat in a nearby bedroom while an full-on orgy between the maneaters and their guy followers happens in the main living room. ted informs karen that he heard through the grapevine that joe boy and his

in blood, as well as a large ring literally nailed through her nose. also with the near-dead honey pot is a note from joe boy threatening the maneaters with further retribution should they start another brawl with them.\\r\\nafter dropping off honey pot at a local hospital, queen and the rest of the maneaters head out in search of honey pot\\'s assailants, including joe boy. the vigilante girls first head to a bar where joe boy is said to hang out at. the bartender refuses to disclose any information about joe boy\\'s whereabouts and he gets severely beaten by the angry gang leader.

queen, who arranges an ambush. whitey and terry return to the restaurant where they slash joe boy\\'s tires of his car. when joe boy confronts them, whitey sprays bug spray into joe boy\\'s face and she and terry take off on one motorcycle. joe boy takes terry\\'s motorcycle and gives chase.\\r\\nhowever, this is all part of queen\\'s plan as she, always on top of the situation, had told whitey and terry to initiate a confrontation that will engage joe boy in a pursuit. as planned, joe boy follows whitey and terry along a road where queen, karen, supergirl, ginger, delta, and the rest of the

              " ('the film begins with a drunken and downtrodden catholic priest telling his story to a sympathetic bartender (brian george). father brian finn (edward norton) has been dedicated to his calling since he was a child and now shares the duties of a new york parish with an older priest, fr. havel (miloš forman). rabbi jacob \"jake\" schram (ben stiller), best friends with brian since childhood, is the youngest rabbi at his synagogue; his lack of effort to find a jewish wife often results in his mother, ruth (anne bancroft) and other women of his congregation setting him up on blind dates, much to his dismay. the two men show a close bond, even in their professions, where the two are planning the opening of a jointly sponsored community center. in its earlier days, the friendship included a third party. via flashbacks and reminiscent musings, anna reilly (jenna elfman) is introduced: she met jake and brian in middle school, after beating up a bully who was picking on them. the three became great friends, and enjoyed their childhood together. unfortunately, anna\\'s father got a new job that resulted in the reillys moving to california, and ultimately she lost touch with brian and jake.\\r\\nsixteen years later, anna calls her old friends out of the blue and the friendship is rekindled when her company temporarily reassigns her to a new york position. feelings quickly begin to run deeper than before, as anna, despite her workaholic tendencies, is as vibrant as brian and jake remembered her; however, it is the men\\'s careers that are the most problematic. she and jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to be involved in a serious relationship with her because she is not jewish, a fact which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and also with his mother (who disowned her eldest son - jake\\'s older brother ethan - for marrying outside the faith). between the religious conflict and their desire to spare the feelings of their mutual friend, the relationship is kept mostly secret, resulting in both humorous and harmful complications. as the months pass, both jake and anna\\'s feelings for each other become stronger but due to the aforementioned issues, jake still refuses the relationship as a serious one, despite anna dropping hints to him about her having been recently taking a class (but refusing to tell him what kind of class it is), and her becoming visibly upset when they run into members of jake\\'s congregation while on a date and jake introducing her only as \"my old friend anna\".\\r\\nmeanwhile, brian is involved in his own test of faith as he struggles with his feelings for anna despite his vows. apart from praying about the situation and discussing it with fr. havel, he keeps these thoughts mostly to himself. brian begins misinterpreting anna\\'s words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her. anna tells jake that she wants things to be more serious between them and he does not respond well. while the three have dinner one night with jake\\'s mother ruth, ruth has a private conversation with anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about anna and jake\\'s secret relationship. jake and brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later jake and anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration. anna calls brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment. still unaware of what\\'s been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him, then kisses her and admits his love. when she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with jake and finally admits that she and jake have been seeing each other secretly for months. feeling embarrassed and rejected, brian raids anna\\'s liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize. he leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets. the next day, still drunk, brian stumbles into jake\\'s temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi. he leaves and stumbles around the city, which brings the movie back to the very first scene with the bartender.\\r\\nas the community center\\'s grand opening approaches, along with the last days of anna\\'s east coast assignment, the relationships begin to mend, first with jake reconciling with brian, followed by anna reconciling with brian shortly after. a discussion between the two men prompts jake to go to anna\\'s office building, with brian shouting encouragement at him as he runs down the street. jake interrupts anna\\'s going away office party and manages to get her attention from a window in the building across the street and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right. later that evening, they surprise brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center, which looks to be off to a successful start. anna greets rabbi lewis (eli wallach) as he passes by and asks about their meetings together, referencing the class that anna had told jake briefly she had been taking, at which point it becomes clear that she had been taking classes to convert to judaism. she tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is also now staying in new york, with jake clearly thrilled. the film ends happily with the three childhood friends posing for a photo together.',\n",

they were among the el-aurians rescued by the enterprise-b in 2293. guinan explains that soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon, which is a portal to the \"nexus\", an extra-dimensional realm where time has no meaning and anyone can experience whatever they desire. picard and data determine that soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon due to the uncertainty that the ship will survive long enough to ensure his success, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, which alters gravitational forces in the neighborhood, and that he will attempt to reenter the nexus on veridian iii by destroying its sun—and, by extension, veridian iv\\'s quarter-billion inhabitants.\\r\\nupon entering the veridian system, enterprise makes contact with the duras bird of prey. picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for la forge, but insists that he be transported to soran\\'s location first. la forge is returned to enterprise, but with a small camera implanted in his visor. this causes him to inadvertently reveal enterprise\\'s shield frequency, allowing the duras sisters to fire weapons directly through the shields and inflict crippling damage on enterprise. enterprise destroys the bird of prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. commander william riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive. the shock wave from the star drive\\'s destruction sends the saucer crashing to the surface of veridian iii.\\r\\npicard fails to talk soran out of his plan and is too late to stop him from launching his missile. the collapse of the veridian star alters the course of the nexus ribbon as predicted, and it sweeps picard and soran away while the shock wave from the star obliterates everything in the system. in the nexus, picard finds himself surrounded by the family he never had, including a wife and children, but realizes it is an illusion. he is confronted by an \"echo\" of guinan. after being told that he may leave whenever he chooses and go wherever and whenever he wishes, guinan sends him to meet kirk, also safe in the nexus. though kirk is at first reluctant to leave, he likewise comes to the eventual realization that nothing in the nexus is real. picard convinces kirk to return to veridian iii, rather than earlier at amargosa, assuring him that stopping saron will fulfill his desire to make a difference.\\r\\nthe two leave the nexus, with picard choosing to have them arrive on veridian iii only minutes before soran launches the missile. kirk distracts soran long enough for picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill soran. kirk is fatally injured by a fall during the encounter; as he dies, picard assures him that he made a difference. picard buries kirk on a hillside before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the wreckage of the enterprise saucer. three federation starships enter orbit to retrieve enterprise\\'s survivors, but the ship itself cannot be salvaged. as riker laments that he will never sit in the captain\\'s chair of the ship, picard muses that given the name\\'s legacy, this won\\'t be the last ship to carry the name enterprise.',\n",

(he doesn\\'t drink.) she remarks that the bartender sol (rahul panday) knows all her secrets. while leaving the bar, their car is attacked by an apparently drunk man, who seems to know teesta. teesta urges pratyush to leave fast. when he brings her back home, he realizes that his car keys are missing. he waits as she looks for them.\\r\\nwhen teesta gets into her bedroom, she is mysteriously murdered. she stumbles into pratyush\\'s arms, fatally stabbed, and collapses. scared and confused, pratyush leaves immediately. one of the neighbors, a weird and on-and-off senile old fellow called murli mansukhani (shauket baig) sees him leave.\\r\\nwhen the cops begin to investigate, they find that teesta had a roommate sonali (jasmine) and that sonali is engaged to a prominent businessman, k.k. menon (sanjay singh). the investigating officer, and the hero of this movie, inspector arvind khanvilkar (rahul dev), starts his work. the prime suspect is an unwitting pratyush because he was the last person to see teesta alive.\\r\\na somewhat convoluted plot evolves. sonali has several dark secrets and a good-for-nothing brother prashant (subrotto dutta). teesta was somehow connected to sonali\\'s dark past. menon knows this and wanted to wipe out everything, including prashant. he has prashant kidnapped, and later he tells sol to bump off prashant. there is a three-way fight among them. pratyush arrives upon the scene and witnesses two more murders. a dying prashant advises pratyush to go to sonali at the earliest. in the meantime, the weird old man of 88 antop hill, murli, recalls that he had seen pratyush and follows him to blackmail him. when pratyush asks him to get lost, he goes to sonali\\'s house and tries to blackmail her. aslam durrani visits pratyush and, seeing him, thinks he has probably committed the crime, saying that pratyush would better leave the city and that he wouldn\\'t want anything to do with the latter anymore.\\r\\npratyush contacts the cops but a dimwitted cop sternly asks him to surrender, as the police have found the murder weapon and a blood stained shirt, with pratyush\\'s diary stating 88 antop hill on the fateful date at his house. pratyush panics and goes to sonali to convey prashant\\'s message to her. she does not listen to what he says. here menon and the good inspector show up as well.\\r\\nat this point the crux arises — the inspector says that he has found out that sonali is actually \"sonali shah\", and she was married already to the deceased neeraj shah; it was sonali who killed him because he wouldn\\'t give her a divorce to marry menon. he also says that neeraj\\'s house was ransacked by sonali to find the marriage certificate.\\r\\nat this point, arvind goes to the fridge and finds murli mansukhani lying stabbed in it! the truth is then out. it is known that sonali murdered neeraj and hid his corpse in the fridge and murdered murli because he opened the fridge out of curiosity and found neeraj\\'s corpse. arvind also reveals that sonali killed teesta. sonali says it was because teesta knew about her marriage with neeraj, and used to blackmail her, saying she will make it known to menon. it was sonali who had followed pratyush and teesata on the fateful night back to 88 antop hill, secretly climbed into teesta\\'s bedroom and slit her throat. she further followed pratyush and leaves the knife in his house to implicate him. it is then revealed that menon has murdered prashant, at which sonali is shocked.\\r\\nat this point, menon makes a last effort to save himself and sonali. he tries to bribe arvind with 10 million, saying that he must arrest poor pratyush on charges of all the murders. to this, arvind agrees and shoots pratyush in the shoulder. but the wounded pratyush releases gas from the cylinder nearby and threatens to light his cigarette lighter. while he grabs arvind\\'s phone and tries to call police, menon attacks him and stabs him on the sofa, and arvind quickly turns out the gas. but the wounded pratyush pulls out menon\\'s revolver, kicks him off and shoots him through a cushion.\\r\\nat this point, a dumbfounded sonali picks up a pistol and threatens to kill pratyush. arvind tells her not to, but she pulls the trigger — only to find that the gun is empty.\\r\\narvind then apologizes to pratyush, saying he had to wound the latter or else menon would\\'ve killed pratyush. sonali is then arrested on charges of multiple homicide and attempt to kill pratyush.\\r\\nthe film ends with the inspector relieving pratyush of all charges in the case and requesting him to take care of a pet dog. pratyush\\'s wife and child return.',\n",

ownership of the lucrative grand imperial hotel in the fictional town of silver hill, colorado. a letter written by barnesworth claims that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. baxter, clearly chafing under the dehumanizing conditions at the office, views this as a golden opportunity.\\r\\nbaxter quits his job in a grand spectacle and moves his family to colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. the family finds it to be an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, jesse mccord (harry morgan), living in the shed. initially, baxter is inclined to turn mccord out for what appeared to be breaking and entering until he is pressured by his family—mainly his children—to allow mccord to stay. mccord offers his services as a bartender, but baxter assigns him the job of bellhop, which mccord takes with a characteristically easygoing nature.\\r\\nsome time later, baxter and his wife are walking on the hills behind the hotel, trying to decide what to do about the hotel. with no real attractions nearby, they are unsure what, if anything, they could do with the property until a chance meeting with wally, a local boy employed by the gas station, out for a ride on his snowmobile. he apologizes for making tracks in baxter\\'s snow and is about to leave when baxter stops him to ask what he meant. wally explains that the grand imperial sits on a huge amount of property, \"about as far as you can see,\" as he puts it. baxter realizes that the hilly terrain is exactly the attraction the hotel needs; they can turn the hill adjacent to the hotel into a ski lodge.\\r\\nbaxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. local banker martin ridgeway (keenan wynn) expresses great interest in baxter\\'s daring idea, but also offers to buy the lodge in order to convert it into a boys\\' school in honor of the deceased uncle. baxter declines. ridgeway, in turn, declines to give baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management, likely making his business venture a failure. all during this exchange, ridgeway\\'s secretary appears quite agitated, but does not speak up. baxter leaves the bank without a loan, but determined to find one.\\r\\nbaxter searches for funding elsewhere and finds a friendly banker in the next town named mr. wainwright (george kirkpatrick) who is interested in baxter\\'s venture. wainwright agrees to meet with baxter at a ski lodge — baxter, not willing to make the same mistake as he did with ridgeway by admitting he knows nothing about hotels or skiing, claims to be an avid skier. wainwright, taking baxter at his word, takes him to a black diamond run called \"nightmare alley.\" faking an injury, baxter convinces wainwright to start without him. however, after knocking down a ski rack, baxter is shoved by an irate skier, sending him down the run anyway. after quite a few close calls, not to mention downing more than a few other skiers, baxter ends up crashing into a tree. the sensational story is picked up by the local press, which gives the chaos and injuries caused by baxter\\'s run a fair amount of coverage.\\r\\nwhile he is recovering, martin ridgeway gives baxter a check for $3,000, taking feigned pity on him. baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. meanwhile, local bumpkin wally perkins (michael mcgreevey) works with jesse to repair the hot water heater. the water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. ridgeway\\'s check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift baxter had in mind. jesse comes to the rescue by pulling an old donkey engine out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and using it as a makeshift ski lift.\\r\\nthe restored hotel opens to little fanfare, receiving few customers for several days. when wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. the baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort.\\r\\nall goes well until wally commences ski training classes. having never taught skiing before, wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge while clinging to a pine tree. using the donkey engine and a rope to lower john baxter down the mountain to rescue wally, jesse accidentally jostles a loose piece of lit firewood onto one of the ropes anchoring the engine in place. baxter rescues wally, who suffers a broken arm. the burning rope tears, setting the donkey engine free. it slides down the mountain with baxter in tow, still roped to the machine after having rescued wally. the engine plows through the hotel. all of the guests check out, leaving the baxters out of money once again.\\r\\njohn baxter sheepishly goes back to ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which ridgeway flatly refuses. baxter notices a sign for the silver hills snowmobile race, with $5,000 prize, a prize that has been won by ridgeway for the last several runs of the race. though baxter has never used a snowmobile, he assumes wally can drive his slapdash snowmobile. unfortunately, wally\\'s broken arm from his skiing accident prevents his involvement. baxter decides to drive the snowmobile himself, with jesse as his partner. baxter\\'s wife, furious that he would risk his own safety and health and certain that the lodge has become an obsession that has eclipsed his duties to his family, threatens to leave.\\r\\nthe day of the race, 75-year-old jesse has second thoughts about partaking in the race aboard wally\\'s decrepit snowmobile (dubbed \"the mighty mongrel\"). baxter reveals that his wife has indeed left with the children, probably for denver. after a rocky start, baxter and mccord actually end up passing much of the pack, but a series of unfortunate turns and one unexpected shortcut ends up breaking one of the snowmobile\\'s skis. heading into town both in the lead and under full power due to a broken throttle, baxter plows into a snowbank, breaking the other ski. ridgeway makes the same mistake, and the two end up on the final stretch only seconds apart. though they come close, baxter and mccord narrowly miss the finish line. ridgeway wins first place, and baxter ends up riding the snowmobile for hours as it will not shut off or stop. as he returns to town well after dark, his snowmobile towed by a horse, he finds his wife waiting for him.\\r\\nthe next day, ridgeway brings the deed transfer papers to the lodge for baxter to sign. an impassioned plea by baxter for an extension is again denied, and when baxter presses the issue, ridgeway threatens to begin the foreclosure process, but offers to buy the resort from baxter for practically nothing, again mentioning his jacob barnesworth school for boys plan. ridgeway\\'s secretary miss wigginton (mary wickes) happens to be present during this exchange, and blows her stack in front of ridgeway, telling everyone the truth: the property includes several hundred acres of pine timberland originally donated to the local indian tribes by barnesworth for as long as the tribe inhabited the land. as the tribe has moved away or died out, the land reverts to the estate. ridgeway wants to buy the resort in order to log the highly valuable timber located on the property. jesse adds that the land the town was built on was granted by jacob farnsworth on the condition that several buildings be erected, including two hospitals (one an animal hospital) and library. baxter\\'s son notes that he has not seen a library, and, in genuine confusion, asks why the land has not reverted to baxter. wigginton realizes that he is absolutely right, and that silver hill is in violation of the grant, meaning that the entire town is built on land now owned by baxter — including ridgeway\\'s bank. ridgeway, now finding himself on the back foot, finds himself being pressed by baxter for an extension on the loan, which is quickly granted. baxter pushes his advantage, and ridgeway quickly agrees to loan baxter the money necessary to not only repair but greatly expand the resort.',\n",

westrum was a severe alcoholic; he implies that sturmfuller was abusing his wife and possibly his daughter (this is made explicit in the novel); and the vigilantes intended to murder someone in cold blood (lowe\\'s logic cannot explain brady\\'s murder, however). lowe then apologizes and tells marty that he is going to drown him in the river when marty is unwittingly saved by local farmer elmer zinneman.\\r\\nthe siblings tell red about their letter-writing campaign to reverend lowe. after calming down the furious red, they manage to convince him that lowe is connected to the murders and attempted to kill marty: the silver bullet has dents and a scrape of blue paint that matches lowe\\'s car. unable to deny the evidence in front of him, red heads straight to sheriff haller. although red admits that he has his doubts, and haller does not believe lowe to be a killer, red nonetheless persuades the sheriff to investigate. that night, haller, still skeptical but desperate to find the killer, is shocked to discover evidence that at least some of marty\\'s story may be true. haller suddenly finds lowe, who has locked himself in his garage to restrain himself from further killings, but before haller can arrest him, lowe transforms and kills haller by striking him numerous times on the head with the peacemaker.\\r\\nmarty and jane both know that with haller out of the way, the werewolf now has an easy path to come after them. marty theorizes that lowe transforms more often than just the full moon, but that when the moon is at its peak he loses all his humanity and becomes more driven to kill; thus, he will attack marty on the next full moon, when he is most unrestrained. desperate and running out of options, they convince red to take jane\\'s silver cross and marty\\'s silver medallion to someone who can melt it down into a silver bullet. under the guise of marty having just \"discovered the lone ranger\", red has a local gunsmith make the bullet; the gunsmith proves to be a master at his craft, making the bullet so it will be accurate. when red asks an offhand question, \"… what the heck are you gonna shoot a forty-four bullet at anyway, made outta silver?\" the gunsmith replies, \"how \\'bout a werewolf?\"\\r\\non halloween, red shows up at the coslaws with some fortuitous news: he has won a romantic getaway to new york, but since he separated from his wife, he gives the tickets to nan and bob. questioned by marty and jane, red reveals that he bought the tickets as a ruse to get their parents to safety. with the now full moon in the sky, they head inside to wait for the werewolf. despite their best efforts, the three fall asleep and are startled awake when red (who has fallen asleep with a lit cigarette in his fingers), burns himself, jumps up and drops the gun, nearly setting it off. red begins to doubt that the werewolf is real, much less going to show up, and orders marty and jane to bed. jane suddenly screams in horror as she sees the werewolf looking at her from a living room window, although when red looks he finds nothing. red starts to think that he is being fooled by the children and unloads the pistol. at that moment the werewolf tears the power cables out of the box and cuts the power to the house, leaving the trio with only the light from the fireplace. the werewolf then smashes through the wall of the house, attacking them. despite red\\'s best efforts he is tossed around like a rag doll and jane is suspended in midair.as uncle red continues to receive multiple wwe style body slams into various pieces of household furniture,marty manages to retrieve the cartridge (which was tossed around in the melee and had fallen through a heating vent in the floor) and shoots the werewolf in the right eye with the silver bullet. the corpse turns back into reverend lowe and has one last spasm before dying. afterwards marty and jane both say, \"i love you\" and the narrator then says that she too can now say it.',\n",

had promised to mail marcus an airplane ticket. however, lucy doesn't believe billy was being serious.\\r\\nlater that day, marcus sells stolen merchandise to children during recess at the local

telling him he changed his mind and he is resuming his plans to go to new mexico, though promises he’ll return in two weeks.\\r\\non the day marcus and melena are supposed to leave for new mexico,

he accepts.\\r\\nmonte has his doubts about lucy, so he strikes a deal with jeanette (matlin), a deaf colleague: jeanette will marry him if he pays her $10,000. this leads to a conversation monte has on the phone with his friend. lucy overhears the conversation and decides to eavesdrop. he explains to his friend his intention to rob the restaurant, and asks his friend to help, who declines.\\r\\nlucy confronts monte while they are waiting for her turn at the audition. both become frustrated because they both want to rob the restaurant at the same time. lucy is called up and begins her escape routine. unfortunately, the audition goes disastrously as she cannot find the key to free herself. lucy is obviously upset so monte takes her to a bar where they discuss who's going to rob the restaurant. they can't work together, as that would mean splitting the money, and monte needs it all to pay jeanette. monte comes up with another plan: he will help lucy rob the restaurant if she marries him. this way, monte won't need the $10,000 to pay jeanette.\\r\\nlucy begins to cry again so monte tries to cheer her up by talking about mrs. houdini. lucy, still upset, explains that mrs. houdini was vital to harry houdini's escape routines: before mr. houdini commenced with his trick, mrs. houdini would kiss him and transfer the key he needed to escape from her mouth to his. lucy's mood has improved somewhat after this so the two walk down the street and discuss the possibility of sleeping together. monte wants to, but lucy declines and explains viv was hoping to sleep with him first. with viv in mind, he suggests that a third person that doesn't work at the restaurant and wouldn't be recognised would be ideal for the robbery. lucy agrees and the two head to vivian's apartment, where she's working on her 'self-defence bra'.\\r\\nit's later on when the trio discuss the plan: at 12:00 am, viv will enter the restaurant and demand money, which she will take from the register. to appear more threatening, she will carry a gun which fires blanks. it's vitally important that it happens before the 12:30 am drop. monte and lucy will create some clever diversions so that the guests will be on edge. at 11:59, they will drop a loud set of glasses to really unsettle the guests; seconds later, viv will enter. viv reluctantly agrees and takes the gun from monte.\\r\\nat 11:59, monte and lucy drop the champagne bottles and glasses... but viv doesn't show up. thinking she has dropped out, monte storms off, and lucy follows. she finds him in the freezer causing havoc and messing the room up. with adrenaline rushing through him, he makes out with lucy. as it turns out, viv had a flat tyre on her bike, so by the time she turns up in a disguise to commence the robbery the guests are calm and don't take her seriously. she makes threats but the guests laugh at her, so she pretends she's a performing artist and the stunt was part of her act.\\r\\nin the freezer, lucy flees the room, leaving monte confused. she tracks down vivian, who explains what happened. the situation is desperate and 12:30 looms, so viv fires the gun, exclaiming, 'sorry, i guess i wasn't kidding... money. now. all of it.' jeanette, who works at the register, can't understand vivian because the disguise is covering her face. annoyed, viv presses a button on her bra, which causes two knife-like spikes to stick out of it. jeanette is fascinated and happily hands over a bag of money. lucy and monte leave the restaurant and later all three of them can be seen throwing money into the air, celebrating.\\r\\nexpecting lucy to uphold her side of the deal, monte heads to the register office and waits for her. meanwhile, lucy heads back to the antique shop to buy the ring, only to find it has been sold. she heads over to viv's apartment to mope. viv's in a cheerful mood, however: since the robbery, companies have been calling her about her 'self-defence bra'. lucy doesn't share the enthusiasm. viv asks if she and monte tied the knot. lucy realises she completely forgot, so she and vivian rush to the register office.\\r\\nthe girls arrive and monte whisks lucy away, but they are not able to marry because she left her i.d. at viv's apartment. there is simply no time to get married any other day, so monte leaves in anger. the two girls leave, too, and lucy, full of guilt, confesses to vivian that she made out with monte. the two talk about him before deciding to head to a bar and get drunk.\\r\\nmonte, meanwhile, is at the restaurant when cecil and dante approach him. it is revealed that monte didn't need to get married to get his green card, but because he made a $2,000,000 bet with cecil and dante. we also learn that monte has a terrible gambling problem. he manages to convince them to give him another chance, and they make another bet: lucy will have one minute to escape from a straitjacket, hanging upside down, with her feet cuffed, inside a locked canvas bag, underwater (in cecil and dante's giant aquarium at the restaurant). if she is unable to, monte will owe them $4,000,000, or, he will undergo plastic surgery to make himself look like dante.\\r\\nof course, monte can't win without lucy's help. he arrives at lucy's apartment, where the two girls are asleep. he wakes them up and discovers they have serious hangovers. worried that they won't help him, monte makes up a story, 'cecil and dante know about the robbery... i don't know how they found out... there's still hope. i made a deal- a bet-a bet with cecil and dante: if we win, they drop all charges, like nothing ever happened... [if we lose,] 20 years hard labour'. vivian and monte believe that they can train lucy, but quickly, for the stunt is to be performed the following night. lucy trains for hours, and before long, the three fall asleep, exhausted. vivian wakes up in the early hours of the morning and leaves, which, in turn, causes monte and lucy to wake up. lucy wants to get up and train, but monte convinces her to stay, and the two make love in lucy's apartment.\\r\\nlater in the morning, lucy is out shopping and sees cecil and dante driving past in a taxi. she tries to avoid them, but they drag her into the vehicle so they can rant about their excitement for the bet. after a bit of chatting, lucy finds out that cecil and dante don't know who committed the robbery, even though monte told her they knew. she discovers that monte will have to pay cecil and dante $4,000,000 (or get plastic surgery) if he doesn't win the bet, even though monte told her they'd go to jail if the bet was lost. lucy is visibly shocked and asks the driver to stop before climbing out of the taxi.\\r\\nit's the night of the bet and monte is nervous, particularly because lucy hasn't showed up. monte learns that cecil and dante told her the truth about the bet. he now doubts that she will show, but begs the two men to stall the audience until she comes, so they do. lucy finally shows up, surprising cecil, dante, and monte. after an awkward arrival, she puts on the straitjacket, has her legs cuffed, and is almost in the canvas bag when monte interrupts, wanting a 'goodbye kiss'. lucy, still angry at him, refuses, until she sees he has mrs. houdini's wedding ring between his teeth.\\r\\nlucy is locked in the bag, suspended upside down, and dropped into the water. she appears to be struggling to escape when several gun shots fire. it's vivian, dressed in a red disguise but with the same black veil covering her face. she presses her 'self-defence bra' and the spikes once again stick out. she demands money and the audience give it to her whilst monte stares in shock. jeanette also gives her two bags of money from the register.\\r\\nwhen viv leaves, the attention turns back to lucy. the canvas bag is still in the water. monte- aware that if he tries to save her, he will lose the bet- jumps into the water, before finding out that the bag is devoid of lucy. the audience is confused until they find her on the second level of the restaurant, dripping from the water but otherwise fine.\\r\\nlater on, monte is still somewhat damp but approaches lucy nonetheless. she's less angry with him since he risked $4,000,000 to save her, but she shakes his hand and prepares to leave him for the last time. monte calls her back and asks if she will go out with him the following day, but this time, it's for real. the two kiss before lucy leaves. outside, viv is waiting by two new bikes from cecil and dante and the movie ends with the two girls riding down the dark street.\",\n",

harvey, who is especially gifted with children, follows to see if he can help. when they get back to april\\'s compartment, she confides in patsy that ivan may have a point in what he had said on their way to the station, about being at home, nurturing her very own child - and a young husband. realising that she is thinking of marrying harvey, patsy rushes back to ivan\\'s compartment to break the news to him. meanwhile, harvey is rather taken aback by the baby\\'s similar appearance to april\\'s, almost as if he were her own. april tries to explain that it is merely a publicity stunt, but harvey cannot bring himself to believe this, and when she asks for ivan\\'s support, unaware that he is fearful of losing his leading lady, he denies that he had anything to do with it. displeased at being fooled, harvey walks out and returns to the observation saloon, and an angry april forces ivan and patsy out of her compartment along with the baby.\\r\\nat fort wayne, mike hands his engine, k4 no. 3763, over to the relief crew and joins the train itself. while he is waiting in the dining car for patsy, he is briefly harassed by a small boy before being joined at his table by harvey. patsy enters the dining car a little later with april and miss prottle. seeing harvey at mike\\'s table, april tries once again to reason with him, but harvey still doesn\\'t believe her. in the end she gets her way by telling him that ivan was the father. ivan soon approaches her table with the baby, and is confused when harvey threatens to knock his teeth down his throat before storming off, but april smugly repeats to ivan what she had said to harvey. horrified, ivan leaves the baby with april and flees to his compartment to pack his suitcase, ordering the train porter to stop the train and let him off in spite of it being scheduled to run straight through to harrisburg. the porter has only just gone to talk to the guard about it when harvey comes to interrogate ivan. before he can do so, ivan reveals to him that it was indeed a mere publicity stunt, leaving harvey rather ashamed of himself.\\r\\nin the dining car, mike has joined patsy and miss prottle on their table and is explaining to miss prottle about various aspects of railroading. he has just finished explaining how he once avoided crashing into a derailed wagon when a goods train flashes past, causing mike to leap from his seat and yell a greeting. he explains to patsy and miss prottle that a friend/relative was driving the goods engine. eventually, patsy and miss prottle head off to help april with the baby, but before she leaves, patsy and mike agree to meet in the observation car later on. in the observation car, mike is just leafing through a newspaper when another passenger comments about the pierson kidnapping, which is still making headline news. he adds that the last such crime was foiled in just three weeks, the kidnapper being sentenced to death while the accomplice, who didn\\'t realise that the kid had been taken hostage in the first place, was given 177 years - effectively a life sentence. mike is shocked when he reads that the baby in question is similar in appearance to the one lent to april tremaine, and was believed to have been heading east. when he sees that the other passenger is a detective, he hastily leaves the saloon and heads for patsy\\'s compartment to check the baby for the one detail that hasn\\'t been seen yet; a mole on his left shoulder.\\r\\nby this time, patsy and miss prottle have the baby ready for bed, but miss prottle insists on staying up late to listen to \"renfrew of the mounted\", a radio series of which she is a big fan. mike hastily offers to look after the baby briefly while they go and listen to the latest installment on the observation saloon radio. as soon as they have gone, the suspicious character looks through the door and remarks to mike about the baby, adding that he will be right outside if he needs any help. he shuts the door behind him, and mike pulls the baby\\'s shirt down to look at his shoulder. sure enough, he sees a dark patch similar to a mole.\\r\\nin the observation saloon, \"renfrew of the mounted\" is just finishing when mike comes in and tries to explain their dilemma to patsy while miss prottle takes charge of the baby, but patsy is so annoyed at his anxious rambling that she mistakes it for lack of interest in her, and accordingly walks out on him. realising that he is on his own, mike reacts by collecting every newspaper in the train before discarding them through the carriage window. in the observation saloon, meanwhile, harvey tries to apologise to april for his misunderstanding, but april refuses to hear him out. ivan, who had opted to stay on the train after all, steps in and reminds harvey that he is a mere, underpaid doctor, and advises that he shouldn\\'t interfere with her career any longer. although suspicious that ivan may have ulterior motives, harvey reluctantly agrees; however, his guilt quickly catches up with him again, and his attempts to make up with april are constantly foiled by ivan staring warily out of his compartment. ironically, every time he himself tries to talk with april, harvey catches him out. this goes on until they catch mike leaving april\\'s compartment. both are taken aback by this, unaware that mike was really helping to open april\\'s suitcase.\\r\\nlater that night, patsy is woken by a sleepless mike, who tells her that, unbeknown to him until too late, the baby had been kidnapped. thankfully, patsy has a plan, and puts mike in charge of the baby until they get a chance to drop him off at a station. mike takes the baby back to his compartment and keeps him occupied by telling him \"the three bears\" until he falls asleep mid-story. shortly, patsy comes and informs him that the train has made an unscheduled stop. mike takes this opportunity to leave the baby in the booking office of the nearby station, but just as he leaves the building, the suspicious man finds the baby with a note in his crib: \"please return to chicago; notify police\". he screws up the note and surreptitiously returns the baby to april\\'s compartment. when mike returns, he finds that the train is being held up for two and a half hours; there is a flood in the valley, and the express engine has been commandeered to take a consignment of coal trucks to the town affected by the flood. the other engine, a d16, is unable to make it fast enough. mike suggests that they use the smaller engine to pull the broadway limited, but the driver and fireman are sceptical, saying that they \"couldn\\'t get enough head on that to haul the limited around the block\". mike however is insistent, and challenges the superintendent, mulcany, into firing the engine for him. with that, mike and mulcany prepare the d16 while no. 3673 is shunted onto the coal trucks. the d16 slips violently at first, but with careful handling and some sand on the rails, mike manages to get the express rolling again.\\r\\nback on the train, miss prottle realises that the baby is missing and frantically tells ivan, who orders the guard to call for the police. patsy overhears and rushes miss prottle back to bed before repeating to ivan what mike had told her. realising that they are headed for prison cells if the police are sent for, ivan rushes off to order the guard not to send off the message, only to find he is too late. but almost immediately after he finds this out, he remembers that the baby is missing anyway, so they have no need to worry.\\r\\nmeanwhile, april is woken up to find the baby on her bedside table. although confused at first as to how the baby got into her compartment and why he is wide awake, she sees a chance to make up her dispute with harvey, and asks the porter to send for him. when harvey arrives, he deduces that the baby just isn\\'t tired, much to april\\'s relief, but kindly offers to stay and keep an eye on him. by this time april is beginning to realise just how right ivan was about babies, and expresses to harvey a desire to have one of her own. ivan\\'s words are still playing on harvey\\'s mind, however, and he is therefore rather pessimistic about this until april tells him that she has had enough of making films with ivan. they both head off to ivan\\'s compartment, where april confesses her love to harvey, and the two of them share a kiss just as ivan opens his door. ivan is horrified, not only because harvey went back on his word, but also at april\\'s intention to quit from hollywood and marry harvey. they leave ivan pacing back and forth in his compartment, ranting and raving to himself in russian as he tries desperately to work out a way round it.\\r\\nby dawn, ivan is still pacing in his compartment, unable to sleep, when he hits on a compromise whereby (he hopes) everyone will win. excited, he heads off to harvey\\'s compartment and, admitting that he has been rather heartless up till now, proposes to build harvey\\'s life-ambition - \"the finest clinic that science can dream up/money can buy\". harvey is unconvinced at first, but ivan promises to pay him the required $50,000 and give him a contract before he leaves the train. while they are discussing this, the express enters harrisburg, where it is to change engines and proceed to new york behind a gg1 electric locomotive. as soon as they have stopped, mulcany congratulates mike on his expert handling of the little d16 and wishes him a nice holiday. mike returns to the train feeling pleased with himself, unaware that the police have begun to search the limited for the baby. following a brief visit from one of the policemen, ivan confides in harvey about their predicament, and is shocked to hear from harvey that the baby is still aboard the train. he runs back to april\\'s compartment, where april is just dressing the baby for the day, and explains to her how he had been kidnapped. patsy enters shortly after, and is shocked to find the baby on april\\'s bed. ivan hands her the baby and forces her into her own compartment before hastily organising a ruse with april; as soon as the policeman enters, april pretends to be distraught while ivan keeps him occupied for a short while.\\r\\nback in patsy\\'s compartment, mike comes to inform patsy that everything is under control - but patsy reveals that the baby is back aboard the train, much to his bewilderment. he takes the baby back into april\\'s compartment just in time to avoid being caught out by miss prottle and the policeman, whom miss prottle mistakes for \"renfrew of the mounted\".\\r\\nthe policemen soon come to the conclusion that the baby isn\\'t on the train, and head back to make their report. with the coast clear and the engines changed, mike heads to his compartment with the baby while ivan, patsy, april and harvey try to find a way out of their crisis. ivan suggests that they get off at philadelphia, but patsy reminds him that they will be rounded up by the police even if they don\\'t stay on the train until new york. at philadelphia, the suspicious man is met by another two men, who join the train for the last few miles to new york. back in april\\'s compartment, patsy, harvey, april and ivan are still desperately trying to find a solution to their problem - until miss prottle points out that they are all heroes. harvey and april realise that they needn\\'t have worried about the baby after all; they just have to hand him to the police, and they will be on the front page of every newspaper in the usa. at that moment, mike comes in and announces that he is going to surrender as soon as they reach new york, to which all eagerly agree. patsy sends him to get the baby, and mike, elated when he hears that they will all be received to a hero\\'s welcome, instantly obliges. shortly after, the guard hands ivan the contract and a $50,000 cheque for the clinic. harvey is just signing the contract when mike bursts back into the room in a panic, saying that the baby has gone. all six of them spread out to look for the baby, whom mike eventually finds with the suspicious stranger. he approaches him, demanding the baby back, but the other two passengers try to restrain him. mike, however, is too strong for them, and knocks them down before hanging the suspicious passenger on the coat-hanger. patsy enters and is about to take the baby when the other two passengers come round and bar her way, only to be overpowered once again by mike.\\r\\non arrival at pennsylvania station, it is revealed that the pierson baby had been found the night before, and that the suspicious-looking man was actually the baby\\'s father; he had let them use the baby for the publicity stunt on the basis that he could use the $500 reward for a family reunion. the other two characters, he adds, are his brother and brother-in-law from philadelphia. mike points out what he believes is a mole on the baby\\'s shoulder, but it turns out to be a false beauty mark that miss prottle had lost. with their misunderstanding sorted out, patsy heads off to niagara falls with mike while the flustered father leaves for his reunion. before harvey and april leave, however, they read through the contract and find that the clinic is to be located right across the street from ivan\\'s studio, possibly indicating that ivan intended to keep april as his leading lady without interfering too much with her private life with harvey. as for miss prottle, she chases after another policeman, once again believing him to be renfrew.',\n",

his company investment plan. he bids farewell to miss otis (frances ramsden), a young woman who works at an artist\\'s desk down the aisle, giving her the paid-for engagement ring that he had, having planned to marry each of her six older sisters (hortense, irma, harriet, margie, claire, and rosemary) when they had worked there before her. he wanders out, aimlessly through the streets, his life\\'s savings in his trouser pocket.\\r\\nwhile looking through the newspaper want ads for another job, harold is approached by wormy (jimmy conlin), a local con artist, petty gambler, and racetrack tout, who asks harold for some money so he can place a bet. seeing the large amount of cash that harold has, and hoping to get him drunk enough to acquire some of the cash, wormy takes the depressed and unemployed harold to a local bar for a drink. when harold tells the bartender, jake (edgar kennedy), that he has never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \"the diddlebock\", one sip of which is enough to release harold from all his inhibitions. the effects of the alcohol causes harold to yowl uncontrollably. gazing at himself in the bar mirror, harold suddenly declares himself a loser and races out to remake himself. soon harold is getting his hair cut and his nails manicured at a local tailor shop and salon, and is trying on a gaudy plaid suit supplied by tailor formfit franklin (franklin pangborn). in the midst of his transformation, harold overhears wormy talking with his bookie max (lionel stander), and impulsively bets $1,000 of his money on a 15-to-one long shot horse named emmaline. to everyone\\'s surprise, emmaline wins, and the now-rich harold, with $15,000 in his pockets, begins to celebrate all around town on a day-and-a-half binge of spending, gambling, and carousing.\\r\\na few days later, harold wakes up on the sofa inside the house of his widowed sister flora (margaret hamilton) where she chastises him for his wild, irresponsible behavior. he finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe and a ten-gallon cowboy hat. unable to remember much about his drunken binge, particularly about what he did on wednesday which is a total blank, harold wanders outside to return the plaid suit where he is surprised to learn that he now owns a hansom horse-drawn cab complete with an english driver named thomas (robert greig). a worried wormy then rushes up and informs harold that, with winnings from a second bet, harold also bought a bankrupt circus. after a meeting with the animal handlers and circus freaks, harold first seeks help from the kitt-poo home for cats to feed the circus\\' starving lions and tigers. seeing no future with the ownership of the circus, harold then gets the idea to sell the circus to a wall street banker.\\r\\nharold and wormy visit the circus-loving wall street banker lynn sargent (rudy vallee) to ask him to purchase their circus, but he turns them down because he is trying to unload his own bankrupt circus. when the rest of the town\\'s bankers follow suit, harold comes up with an idea. to get past the bank guards, harold dresses up in his plaid suit and brings along jackie, a tame circus lion, who incites panic. carrying a filled thermos, wormy gives shot drinks of the potent \"diddlebock\" cocktail to each of the bankers they visit so their inhibitions will fade and convince them to put in bids for ownership of the circus. things take a turn for the worse when the lion gets loose, in which harold, wormy, and the lion end up on the ledge of a skyscraper, but narrowly avoid plunging to certain death.\\r\\naccording to harold\\'s plan, the three (harold, wormy, and jackie the lion) are arrested and thrown in jail. miss otis bails them out the following day, and they find that the publicity has attracted a mob of bankers at the jail who want to buy the circus – but ringling brothers outbids them. harold celebrates with another \"diddlebock\", and again has another relapse. in the final scene, harold wakes up another day or two later in the horse-drawn cab with miss otis where he learns that he received $175,000 for the sale of the circus, he is now an executive at waggleberry\\'s advertising agency, and that he and miss otis are married. reassuring harold that she truly loves him, miss otis gives him a big kiss, and harold finally remembers what he was doing all day on wednesday. the final shot shows wormy tagging along with them by riding on the back bumper of the cab.[3][4]',\n",

              " ('in 1942, a few months after america\\'s entry into world war ii, secretary ruth wood (jane wyman) lives quietly in manhattan with her physically and emotionally fragile mother, agnes (josephine hutchinson). ruth\\'s co-workers at excelsior shoe manufacturing company are her best friend grace ullman (eileen heckart) and millie kranz (peggie castle), an attractive blonde involved in an affair with her married boss, stephen jalonik (fred clark). also in the office is monty (arte johnson), a young shipping clerk classified by the draft as 4-f, who monitors the war\\'s campaigns on a world map pinned to the wall.\\r\\none evening after work, when a cloudburst forces ruth and other pedestrians to take shelter in the vestibule of an office building, arthur hugenon (van johnson), a cheerful, talkative g.i. stationed in the area, surprises the shy ruth by starting a conversation. when he invites her to dinner, she declines, saying that her housebound mother is expecting her. undeterred, art buys food for three at a delicatessen and accompanies ruth home. agnes, who has distrusted men since her husband harry left her for another woman ten years earlier, receives art with little enthusiasm. during the meal, art, who grew up on a tennessee farm, captivates ruth with his stories and afterward entertains them by playing harry\\'s piano. upon finding the manuscript of an unfinished melody harry composed, art asks permission to take it back to camp, where he and his army buddy dixie will write lyrics for it. when weekend arrives, art takes ruth and grace to a matinee and, as they afterwards walk to a restaurant, passing an auction, ruth impulsively bids on an antique roman coin, which she gives to art for good luck. while the trio is enjoying dinner at the café normandy, ruth is unaware that the piano player is her father (william gargan), whom she has not seen since he left agnes. however, harry recognizes ruth and confides to his bartender friend andy that he has been too ashamed to return to his family.\\r\\nlater, ruth tells art that agnes tried to kill herself after harry left and still hopes for his return. art arrives late for their next sunday date, but brings the lyrics he and dixie have written to harry\\'s music, entitled \"i\\'ll always believe in you\", which he sings together with ruth. as they go out and walk through central park, ruth voices fears about the war and art tells her she must have faith. they then encounter sergeant gil parker (alan king), while he takes snapshots of his new bride, arlene witchy (barbara nichols), who works as a singer. gil asks art to take their picture and then offers to photograph art and ruth. in private, gil warns art that his division will soon be shipped overseas, but art refuses to believe the rumor. at the lagoon, where children are sailing toy boats, art recognizes the name of an elderly man, commodore eli b. windgate (halliwell hobbes), nicknamed \"windy\", a former yachtsman who owned many of the surrounding buildings before losing his fortune in the crash of \\'29. hoping to be a reporter after the war, art senses a good story and interviews windy on the spot. he then goes with ruth to the new york times building and convinces the city editor (unbilled grandon rhodes) to let him write it as a human interest story. instead of taking payment, art asks to be considered for a reporting job after the war. a couple of days later, as ruth waits to meet him for their pre-arranged date, art arrives late, riding on a truck filled with other soldiers, including dixie (unbilled paul smith). with only a brief moment remaining before the truck\\'s departure for the port where the troop ship awaits, he asks ruth to marry him when he returns and, to allay her fears, says he still has the lucky roman coin.\\r\\nfor three months, ruth writes to art every day, but receives no letters in return. finally, a special delivery man knocks on the apartment door and hands a letter from a battlefield chaplain informing her that art died in combat and that his dying wish was that she be told about his love for her. ruth\\'s tear drops on the letter and, in the following days and weeks, she is inconsolable despite the best efforts of her friends and co-workers. millie, moved by ruth\\'s misfortune, feels the need for a fresh and pure start, drops jalonik as her lover and leaves the firm. grace finds ruth consumed by grief, sitting on a bench in central park, and takes her to st. patrick\\'s cathedral, where ruth lights candles under the statue of saint andrew. jalonik, hoping ruth will fill the void left in his extra-marital life by millie, takes her to café normandy and attempts to engage in a warm-up conversation, but ruth is in such a despairing state that she pays no attention as he kisses her on the cheek. a few feet to the side, at the bar, harry has the radio on and hears the familiar strains of his music since, before shipping out, dixie made suggestions to art as to the possibility of marketing harry\\'s music with art\\'s lyrics as a professional song. puzzled, harry dials agnes\\' number but, at the sound of her voice, his resolve falters and he hangs up without speaking. having written numerous letters of explanation and contrition to agnes, he continually found himself tearing them to bits, because of inability to face the hurt he caused her.\\r\\nruth has been returning to the statue of st. andrew and talking to the cathedral\\'s young priest (paul picerni). losing interest in life, she ignores a cold, which turns into pneumonia. mrs. hamer, the upstairs neighbor who has often helped ruth care for agnes, now helps agnes nurse the bedridden ruth. one rainy night, while agnes has dozed off near her bedside, the feverish ruth leaves the apartment just before harry finally musters the courage to walk in with the intention of asking agnes\\' forgiveness for leaving. stunned at seeing him, agnes also realizes that ruth is missing, just as grace telephones. upon being told that ruth has left her sickbed, grace realizes that she must be heading for the cathedral.\\r\\nstanding on the cathedral steps, consumed by fever, ruth hears art\\'s voice speaking her name. delirious, she sees art materialize and slowly approach close enough for an embrace or a kiss as he tells her that love never dies. no longer possessing earthly means of holding on to the roman coin she gifted to him, art returns it to ruth. a moment later, in the midst of the heavy, late evening rain, the priest finds ruth unconscious on the steps, just as grace arrives. seeing the coin clasped in ruth\\'s hand, he shows it to grace, who recognizes it and realizes that, for a brief moment, art had returned to ruth, whose own tenuous hold on life remains clouded in uncertainty at the final fadeout.',\n",

cuba, ruby meets with vitali and they meet with the elderly and imprisoned sicilian mobster santos alicante, who has been in jail in cuba since the 1959 communist takeover after his casino hotel was closed down. vitali tells ruby that they are to spring santos from cuba to put him back in place in the usa as part of a complex operation plan. however, after their visit, vitali accompanies ruby back to his and candy’s hotel room where he secretly tells him the real reason for this assignment; he wants ruby to kill santos because the people that vitali works for feel that santos has outgrown

up a new hotel and casino in las vegas since his return to the united states as well as santos’ affiliates. maxwell supplies ruby with a mini-tape recorder to assist, and ruby makes the assumption that maxwell works for the cia, which maxwell neither denies or admits.\\r\\nruby and candy travel to las vegas and check into santos’ new hotel, where a gala event is taking place that involves a

for his next assassination assignment.\\r\\nsometime later, ruby talks with lenny, an old friend of his, about assignments for cia associates and lenny tells ruby that to take out a \"target\" relies on two or more rifle marksmen and a \"patsy\" or \"fall guy\" to be caught in order to place all the blame for the crime to divert suspicion away from the investigating authorities.\\r\\nmeanwhile,

knoll section near the building to the building.\\r\\nafter watching the events on a tv set, a distraught ruby returns to his club, where proby is rummaging through his desk to look for the audio tape of the recording of the conversation ruby had in las vegas with santos and his associates, but the tape is gone. ruby tells proby, who has not heard about the assassination, that their enemies have won. the following day, david ferrie pays a visit to ruby at the club where they watch a tv broadcast about the arrest of lee harvey oswald and that he also was arrested for killing officer tippit, a regular customer at the club. ferrie tells ruby to forget that they ever met and that he shouldn’t do anything stupid for he calls ruby only a \"small time hood\". ruby vows he will make the world understand.\\r\\nthe next day, ruby goes to the dallas county jail where oswald is being transferred and kills him. ruby is immediately arrested by the police—just as he wanted them to. in jail, ruby refuses to give a statement to his lawyer about his motivation and demands that he be taken to washington to testify before a senate committee about what he knows. at ruby’s trial, he refuses to offer an insanity defense for the murder of oswald and is convicted and sentenced to death. ruby sees maxwell as one of the spectators during the trial and knows that maxwell had some hand in work behind the scenes that has led to his conviction. ruby appeals the verdict, but aware that the conspirators are monitoring his visits, continues to demand that he be taken to washington to testify, but he is refused.\\r\\nseveral months later, while still in prison awaiting an appeal, candy visits ruby to offer him moral support for his actions, while he tells her not to visit him again and to move far away so the members of the conspiracy will not find her. after candy leaves ruby for good, he remains in jail while over the next several months, he thinks that the conspirators are slowly killing him inside when he is forcibly given injections for his failing health. in a final disclaimer, it is said that ruby died from cancer in jail in 1967 and that his request to testify before a senate hearing was never granted.',\n",

an all-female motorcycle gang called the maneaters. the maneaters hang out in an abandoned house and hold weekly motorcycle races at an abandoned airport runway. the leader of the maneaters, the tough-minded queen (betty connell), holds the races and the winner of each race gets first pick from the \"stud line\".\\r\\nthe race begins and karen is the winner, with queen coming in second. nevertheless, queen is a good sport and allows karen to pick first. on this particular day, queen and the rest of the maneaters return to their hideout where a group of young men have also arrived, whom are male groupies to the all-women gang. karen picks out her usual \"stud\", a friendly guy named bill... the same one she has picked for four weeks in a row. however, this is strictly forbidden among the maneaters for according to their code, no maneater is allowed to be attached to anyone or anything but the gang. one of the fastest held rules of the group is that \"all men are mothers\" and no maneater falls in love.\\r\\nhoney pot, a teenage \"mascot\" and follower of the maneaters who wants to join, reports to queen her suspicions about karen\\'s attraction to bill. after debating about it with her fellow members, queen tells honey pot to inform karen that she is to come to the runway that evening. when karen shows up as expected, queen and the rest of the gang angrily decrees to her a punishing ultimatum, karen is to participate in the beating then dragging of bill for face expulsion of the gang. karen gets on her motorcycle and is forced to drag bill, who is tied, beaten, and bruised behind her down the entire stretch of the runway and back. bill is dead after this, and karen\\'s allegiance and loyalty to the gang is proven.\\r\\nanother evening later, honey pot is finally granted membership into the gang. in a hazing ritual, honey pot has her left hand cut open in a blood oath and made to kiss all the members of the gang to prove her sisterhood. next, honey pot is stripped to her underwear and doused in honey and chocolate syrup and made to entertain the entire \"stud line\". following this, honey pot is cleaned off, is given a leather jacket with the maneaters logo stamped on the back like the rest of the members and is formally initiated into the gang.\\r\\nthe next day, the gang rides into the small florida town of medley and terrorizes and harasses the locals by riding their motorcycles through parking lots, through storefronts, and around the front and back lawns of houses. when their antics are stopped by the local police, the townspeople (out of fear of retaliation) refuse to press charges. as a result, the police make no successful arrests. unable to pin anything on the maneaters, the police are forced to let them go, only giving queen and the rest of the maneaters a warning to stay out of trouble.\\r\\nanother week later, the stud line competition is again on, and queen and the rest of the maneaters head off to

(he also begins courting the sister.) grudgingly accepted by the brothers (led by tucker's character, frank reno), he soon learns that they have corrupted local officials, including a judge (played by veteran character actor edgar buchanan), allowing them to operate in that part of the state with near-impunity. the brothers plan a train robbery with barlow, but this proves to be a setup in which they are captured following a shootout and taken to an area jail outside the jurisdiction of the corrupted officials. (in the shootout, barlow's fellow peterson agent, monk claxton, is killed.) townspeople are incited to mob violence and break into the jail and lynch the brothers before they can be brought to trial despite barlow's best efforts to stop this. (apparently the sister accepts his efforts as genuine; in the film's final scene she is still with barlow.)\",\n",

his lack of effort to find a jewish wife often results in his mother, ruth (anne bancroft) and other women of his congregation setting him up on blind dates, much to his dismay. the two men show a close bond, even in their professions, where the two are planning the opening of a jointly sponsored community center. in its earlier days, the friendship included a third party. via flashbacks and reminiscent musings, anna reilly (jenna elfman) is introduced: she met jake and brian in middle school, after beating up a bully who was picking on them. the three became great friends, and enjoyed their childhood together. unfortunately, anna\\'s father got a new job that resulted in the reillys moving to california, and ultimately she lost touch with brian and jake.\\r\\nsixteen years later, anna calls her old friends out of the blue and the friendship is rekindled when her company temporarily reassigns her to a new york position. feelings quickly begin to run deeper than before, as anna, despite her workaholic tendencies, is as vibrant as brian and jake remembered her; however, it is the men\\'s careers that are the most problematic. she and jake begin sleeping together, but he is reluctant to be involved in a serious relationship with her because she is not jewish, a fact which could compromise his relationship with his congregation and also with his mother (who disowned her eldest son - jake\\'s older brother ethan - for marrying outside the faith). between the religious conflict and their desire to spare the feelings of their mutual friend, the relationship is kept mostly secret, resulting in both humorous and harmful complications. as the months pass, both jake and anna\\'s feelings for each other become stronger but due to the aforementioned issues, jake still refuses the relationship as a serious one, despite anna dropping hints to him about her having been recently taking a class (but refusing to tell him what kind of class it is), and her becoming visibly upset when they run into members of jake\\'s congregation while on a date and jake introducing her only as \"my old friend anna\".\\r\\nmeanwhile, brian is involved in his own test of faith as he struggles with his feelings for anna despite his vows. apart from praying about the situation and discussing it with fr. havel, he keeps these thoughts mostly to himself. brian begins misinterpreting anna\\'s words and actions (some of which are subtle signals to jake as their affair is kept under wraps) and even has an erotic dream about her; he begins to seriously consider quitting the priesthood to pursue a romantic relationship with her. anna tells jake that she wants things to be more serious between them and he does not respond well. while the three have dinner one night with jake\\'s mother ruth, ruth has a private conversation with anna, where she tearfully reveals that she knows about anna and jake\\'s secret relationship. jake and brian walk in on the ladies having a tearful moment, and later jake and anna have an argument over the religious issues complicating their romance, which ends in the two parting ways in frustration. anna calls brian for comfort and he rushes over to her apartment. still unaware of what\\'s been going on, he takes her tearful ramblings to be a confession of feelings for him, then kisses her and admits his love. when she interrupts him, he first assumes it to be guilt based on his vows, but she tells him she is in love with jake and finally admits that she and jake have been seeing each other secretly for months. feeling embarrassed and rejected, brian raids anna\\'s liquor cabinet, angrily cutting off her attempts to re-assure him and apologize. he leaves and spends the whole night out drinking on the streets. the next day, still drunk, brian stumbles into jake\\'s temple and interrupts a post-bar mitzvah gathering, resulting in a confrontation with jake that ends with the priest punching the rabbi. he leaves and stumbles around the city, which brings the movie back to the very first scene with the bartender.\\r\\nas the community center\\'s grand opening approaches, along with the last days of anna\\'s east coast assignment, the relationships begin to mend, first with jake reconciling with brian, followed by anna reconciling with brian shortly after. a discussion between the two men prompts jake to go to anna\\'s office building, with brian shouting encouragement at him as he runs down the street. jake interrupts anna\\'s going away office party and manages to get her attention from a window in the building across the street and calls to explain himself and offer to set things right. later that evening, they surprise brian in the middle of his karaoke number at the interfaith center, which looks to be off to a successful start. anna greets rabbi lewis (eli wallach) as he passes by and asks about their meetings together, referencing the class that anna had told jake briefly she had been taking, at which point it becomes clear that she had been taking classes to convert to judaism. she tells him she hopes to pick it up again as she is also now staying in new york, with jake clearly thrilled. the film ends happily with the three childhood friends posing for a photo together.',\n",

he is presumed dead.\\r\\nin 2371, the crew of the uss enterprise-d celebrate the promotion of worf to lieutenant commander. captain jean-luc picard receives a message that his brother and nephew were killed in a fire. since picard never fathered children of his own, the family line will end with him. enterprise receives a distress call from an observatory in orbit of the star amargosa, where they rescue the el-aurian dr. tolian soran. the android data and engineer geordi la forge discover a compound called trilithium in a hidden room of the observatory. soran appears, knocks la forge unconscious, and launches a trilithium solar probe at amargosa. the probe causes the star to implode, sending a shock wave toward the observatory. soran and la forge are transported away by a klingon bird of prey belonging to the treacherous duras sisters, who had stolen the trilithium for soran in exchange for the designs for a trilithium weapon. data is rescued just before the station is destroyed by the shock wave.\\r\\nguinan, enterprise\\'s bartender, tells picard more about soran; they were among the el-aurians rescued by the enterprise-b in 2293. guinan explains that soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon, which is a portal to the \"nexus\", an extra-dimensional realm where time has no meaning and anyone can experience whatever they desire. picard and data determine that soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon due to the uncertainty that the ship will survive long enough to ensure his success, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, which alters gravitational forces in the neighborhood, and that he will attempt to reenter the nexus on veridian iii by destroying its sun—and, by extension, veridian iv\\'s quarter-billion inhabitants.\\r\\nupon entering the veridian system, enterprise makes contact with the duras bird of prey. picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for la forge, but insists that he be transported to soran\\'s location first. la forge is returned to enterprise, but with a small camera implanted in his visor. this causes him to inadvertently reveal enterprise\\'s shield frequency, allowing the duras sisters to fire weapons directly through the shields and inflict crippling damage on enterprise. enterprise destroys the bird of prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. commander william riker orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship which separates from the star drive. the shock wave from the star drive\\'s destruction sends the saucer crashing to the surface of veridian iii.\\r\\npicard fails to talk soran out of his plan and is too late to stop him from launching his missile. the collapse of the veridian star alters the course of the nexus ribbon as predicted, and it sweeps picard and soran away while the shock wave from the star obliterates everything in the system. in the nexus, picard finds himself surrounded by the family he never had, including a wife and children, but realizes it is an illusion. he is confronted by an \"echo\" of guinan. after being told that he may leave whenever he chooses and go wherever and whenever he wishes, guinan sends him to meet kirk, also safe in the nexus. though kirk is at first reluctant to leave, he likewise comes to the eventual realization that nothing in the nexus is real. picard convinces kirk to return to veridian iii, rather than earlier at amargosa, assuring him that stopping saron will fulfill his desire to make a difference.\\r\\nthe two leave the nexus, with picard choosing to have them arrive on veridian iii only minutes before soran launches the missile. kirk distracts soran long enough for picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill soran. kirk is fatally injured by a fall during the encounter; as he dies, picard assures him that he made a difference. picard buries kirk on a hillside before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the wreckage of the enterprise saucer. three federation starships enter orbit to retrieve enterprise\\'s survivors, but the ship itself cannot be salvaged. as riker laments that he will never sit in the captain\\'s chair of the ship, picard muses that given the name\\'s legacy, this won\\'t be the last ship to carry the name enterprise.',\n",

describes to jamie her disappointing life in ohio, her dysfunctional and eccentric colleagues, and her desires to be back in new york and to never return to ohio (\"a summer in ohio\"). at the end of this song it is revealed that she and jamie are married.\\r\\njamie and cathy walk to a gazebo in central park, sharing a conversation, though, at first, the audience only hears jamie\\'s side. jamie proposes to her, cathy eventually says yes, and they are then shown getting married in same location (\"the next ten minutes\"). it is the only point in the film when the characters sing a duet and are in the same time and place. afterwards, cathy\\'s side of the conversation at the gazebo is heard, as cathy\\'s timeline continues to moves towards the beginning of their relationship.\\r\\njamie is facing and resisting temptation and advances from other women, especially now his fame as a writer has escalated (33 weeks as a bestseller). he expresses his desires to remain faithful to cathy, and continues to try and resist (\"a miracle would happen\"). cathy, meanwhile, is auditioning for an off-broadway role in new york (\"when you come home to me\"). the audition goes well and she calls jamie about her hopes for landing the role and not returning to ohio for another summer. another christmas passes and jamie gives cathy a gold bracelet. cathy is back at the summer theater in ohio for the summer of 2011 and receives a text from jamie about his coming to see her.\\r\\ncathy is shown unsuccessfully auditioning and calls jamie to talk about her rejection and the fierce competition she has at these auditions. we next see cathy attending a book reading for jamie\\'s book \"light out of darkness.\" at this event cathy realizes that she does not want to be a suburban housewife or a \"girl who requires a man to get by\" (\"climbing uphill\").\\r\\njamie and cathy are having a bitter fight. jamie wants cathy to attend a party to celebrate the publishing of his book. she states she has been to so many of them only to be neglected and ignored by her husband. he decides he\\'ll go but questions cathy about why she really refuses to go with him. he suggests that the lack of success in acting (and having to go back to ohio) is the reason. he says that he believes in her and that they would not be together if he didn\\'t. he asks her to be supportive of him and the fact that he\\'s living out his dream. he accuses her of being unsupportive of his career just because hers is failing (\"if i didn\\'t believe in you\"). cathy ultimately refuses to go with jamie.\\r\\nan unmarried cathy is in the car with jamie, who is going to meet her parents. she tells him about her past relationships and hopes not to end up in a small town life like her friend from high school and her parents (\"i can do better than that\"). upon arriving to her parents\\' house, she asks jamie to move in with her.\\r\\nnear the end of the relationship, jamie wakes up in his apartment beside multiple women, including his editor, alise, and the receptionist at random house (\"nobody needs to know\"). about to leave for ohio to visit cathy, he tries to defend his actions and blames cathy for destroying his privacy and their relationship. jamie promises not to lie to alise and tells her, \"i could be in love with someone like you,\" just as he did to cathy.\\r\\ncathy is ecstatic after her first date with jamie (\"goodbye until tomorrow\"). she proclaims that she has been waiting for jamie her whole life. simultaneously but five years after their first date, jamie sits in their apartment writing a farewell letter to cathy about how hard he tried to save her and their marriage and he couldn\\'t find a way for them both to be happy (\"i could never rescue you\").\\r\\nas a hopeful cathy waits for a tomorrow with jamie, a discouraged jamie tells cathy \"goodbye\". he leaves behind his keys and wedding ring and then exits their apartment. later that evening, we see cathy return to the apartment and open the front door, which relates us back to the opening scene of the film. as cathy closes the door, the film cuts to black.',\n",

(he doesn\\'t drink.) she remarks that the bartender sol (rahul panday) knows all her secrets. while leaving the bar, their car is attacked by an apparently drunk man, who seems to know teesta. teesta urges pratyush to leave fast. when he brings her back home, he realizes that his car keys are missing. he waits as she looks for them.\\r\\nwhen teesta gets into her bedroom, she is mysteriously murdered. she stumbles into pratyush\\'s arms, fatally stabbed, and collapses. scared and confused, pratyush leaves immediately. one of the neighbors, a weird and on-and-off senile old fellow called murli mansukhani (shauket baig) sees him leave.\\r\\nwhen the cops begin to investigate, they find that teesta had a roommate sonali (jasmine) and that sonali is engaged to a prominent businessman, k.k. menon (sanjay singh). the investigating officer, and the hero of this movie, inspector arvind khanvilkar (rahul dev), starts his work. the prime suspect is an unwitting pratyush because he was the last person to see teesta alive.\\r\\na somewhat convoluted plot evolves. sonali has several dark secrets and a good-for-nothing brother prashant (subrotto dutta). teesta was somehow connected to sonali\\'s dark past. menon knows this and wanted to wipe out everything, including prashant. he has prashant kidnapped, and later he tells sol to bump off prashant. there is a three-way fight among them. pratyush arrives upon the scene and witnesses two more murders. a dying prashant advises pratyush to go to sonali at the earliest. in the meantime, the weird old man of 88 antop hill, murli, recalls that he had seen pratyush and follows him to blackmail him. when pratyush asks him to get lost, he goes to sonali\\'s house and tries to blackmail her. aslam durrani visits pratyush and, seeing him, thinks he has probably committed the crime, saying that pratyush would better leave the city and that he wouldn\\'t want anything to do with the latter anymore.\\r\\npratyush contacts the cops but a dimwitted cop sternly asks him to surrender, as the police have found the murder weapon and a blood stained shirt, with pratyush\\'s diary stating 88 antop hill on the fateful date at his house. pratyush panics and goes to sonali to convey prashant\\'s message to her. she does not listen to what he says. here menon and the good inspector show up as well.\\r\\nat this point the crux arises — the inspector says that he has found out that sonali is actually \"sonali shah\", and she was married already to the deceased neeraj shah; it was sonali who killed him because he wouldn\\'t give her a divorce to marry menon. he also says that neeraj\\'s house was ransacked by sonali to find the marriage certificate.\\r\\nat this point, arvind goes to the fridge and finds murli mansukhani lying stabbed in it! the truth is then out. it is known that sonali murdered neeraj and hid his corpse in the fridge and murdered murli because he opened the fridge out of curiosity and found neeraj\\'s corpse. arvind also reveals that sonali killed teesta. sonali says it was because teesta knew about her marriage with neeraj, and used to blackmail her, saying she will make it known to menon. it was sonali who had followed pratyush and teesata on the fateful night back to 88 antop hill, secretly climbed into teesta\\'s bedroom and slit her throat. she further followed pratyush and leaves the knife in his house to implicate him. it is then revealed that menon has murdered prashant, at which sonali is shocked.\\r\\nat this point, menon makes a last effort to save himself and sonali. he tries to bribe arvind with 10 million, saying that he must arrest poor pratyush on charges of all the murders. to this, arvind agrees and shoots pratyush in the shoulder. but the wounded pratyush releases gas from the cylinder nearby and threatens to light his cigarette lighter. while he grabs arvind\\'s phone and tries to call police, menon attacks him and stabs him on the sofa, and arvind quickly turns out the gas. but the wounded pratyush pulls out menon\\'s revolver, kicks him off and shoots him through a cushion.\\r\\nat this point, a dumbfounded sonali picks up a pistol and threatens to kill pratyush. arvind tells her not to, but she pulls the trigger — only to find that the gun is empty.\\r\\narvind then apologizes to pratyush, saying he had to wound the latter or else menon would\\'ve killed pratyush. sonali is then arrested on charges of multiple homicide and attempt to kill pratyush.\\r\\nthe film ends with the inspector relieving pratyush of all charges in the case and requesting him to take care of a pet dog. pratyush\\'s wife and child return.',\n",

ownership of the lucrative grand imperial hotel in the fictional town of silver hill, colorado. a letter written by barnesworth claims that the hotel brings in more than $14,000 per month. baxter, clearly chafing under the dehumanizing conditions at the office, views this as a golden opportunity.\\r\\nbaxter quits his job in a grand spectacle and moves his family to colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. the family finds it to be an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, jesse mccord (harry morgan), living in the shed. initially, baxter is inclined to turn mccord out for what appeared to be breaking and entering until he is pressured by his family—mainly his children—to allow mccord to stay. mccord offers his services as a bartender, but baxter assigns him the job of bellhop, which mccord takes with a characteristically easygoing nature.\\r\\nsome time later, baxter and his wife are walking on the hills behind the hotel, trying to decide what to do about the hotel. with no real attractions nearby, they are unsure what, if anything, they could do with the property until a chance meeting with wally, a local boy employed by the gas station, out for a ride on his snowmobile. he apologizes for making tracks in baxter\\'s snow and is about to leave when baxter stops him to ask what he meant. wally explains that the grand imperial sits on a huge amount of property, \"about as far as you can see,\" as he puts it. baxter realizes that the hilly terrain is exactly the attraction the hotel needs; they can turn the hill adjacent to the hotel into a ski lodge.\\r\\nbaxter attempts to secure funding for his plans. local banker martin ridgeway (keenan wynn) expresses great interest in baxter\\'s daring idea, but also offers to buy the lodge in order to convert it into a boys\\' school in honor of the deceased uncle. baxter declines. ridgeway, in turn, declines to give baxter a loan, citing him as a bad collateral risk and specifically pointing out that baxter has no experience in hotel or restaurant management, likely making his business venture a failure. all during this exchange, ridgeway\\'s secretary appears quite agitated, but does not speak up. baxter leaves the bank without a loan, but determined to find one.\\r\\nbaxter searches for funding elsewhere and finds a friendly banker in the next town named mr. wainwright (george kirkpatrick) who is interested in baxter\\'s venture. wainwright agrees to meet with baxter at a ski lodge — baxter, not willing to make the same mistake as he did with ridgeway by admitting he knows nothing about hotels or skiing, claims to be an avid skier. wainwright, taking baxter at his word, takes him to a black diamond run called \"nightmare alley.\"

close calls, not to mention downing more than a few other skiers, baxter ends up crashing into a tree. the sensational story is picked up by the local press, which gives the chaos and injuries caused by baxter\\'s run a fair amount of coverage.\\r\\nwhile he is recovering, martin ridgeway gives baxter a check for $3,000, taking feigned pity on him. baxter starts making a list of repairs for the lodge. meanwhile, local bumpkin wally perkins (michael mcgreevey) works with jesse to repair the hot water heater. the water heater explodes, tearing a hole in the kitchen wall. ridgeway\\'s check covers the repair, but leaves nothing for the ski lift baxter had in mind. jesse comes to the rescue by pulling an old donkey engine out of mothballs, tying a rope around it, and using it as a makeshift ski lift.\\r\\nthe restored hotel opens to little fanfare, receiving few customers for several days. when wally dynamites a tree stump from the ground, the explosion sets off an avalanche, blocking a passing train carrying several hundred skiers. the baxters quickly shuttle the skiers to their resort.\\r\\nall goes well until wally commences ski training classes. having never taught skiing before, wally loses his balance and skis down a steep mountain, dangling over a ledge while clinging to a pine tree. using the donkey engine and a rope to lower john baxter down the mountain to rescue wally, jesse accidentally jostles a loose piece of lit firewood onto one of the ropes anchoring the engine in place. baxter rescues wally, who suffers a broken arm. the burning rope tears, setting the donkey engine free. it slides down the mountain with baxter in tow, still roped to the machine after having rescued wally. the engine plows through the hotel. all of the guests check out, leaving the baxters out of money once again.\\r\\njohn baxter sheepishly goes back to ridgeway, asking for an extension on his loan, which ridgeway flatly refuses. baxter notices a sign for the silver hills snowmobile race, with $5,000 prize, a prize that has been won by ridgeway for the last several runs of the race. though baxter has never used a snowmobile, he assumes wally can drive his slapdash snowmobile. unfortunately, wally\\'s broken arm from his skiing accident prevents his involvement. baxter decides to drive the snowmobile himself, with jesse as his partner. baxter\\'s wife, furious that he would risk his own safety and health and certain that the lodge has become an obsession that has eclipsed his duties to his family, threatens to leave.\\r\\nthe day of the race, 75-year-old jesse has second thoughts about partaking in the race aboard wally\\'s decrepit snowmobile (dubbed \"the mighty mongrel\"). baxter reveals that his wife has indeed left with the children, probably for denver. after a rocky start, baxter and mccord actually end up passing much of the pack, but a series of unfortunate turns and one unexpected shortcut ends up breaking one of the snowmobile\\'s skis. heading into town both in the lead and under full power due to a broken throttle, baxter plows into a snowbank, breaking the other ski. ridgeway makes the same mistake, and the two end up on the final stretch only seconds apart. though they come close, baxter and mccord narrowly miss the finish line. ridgeway wins first place, and baxter ends up riding the snowmobile for hours as it will not shut off or stop. as he returns to town well after dark, his snowmobile towed by a horse, he finds his wife waiting for him.\\r\\nthe next day, ridgeway brings the deed transfer papers to the lodge for baxter to sign. an impassioned plea by baxter for an extension is again denied, and when baxter presses the issue, ridgeway threatens to begin the foreclosure process, but offers to buy the resort from baxter for practically nothing, again mentioning his jacob barnesworth school for boys plan. ridgeway\\'s secretary miss wigginton (mary wickes) happens to be present during this exchange, and blows her stack in front of ridgeway, telling everyone the truth: the property includes several hundred acres of pine timberland originally donated to the local indian tribes by barnesworth for as long as the tribe inhabited the land. as the tribe has moved away or died out, the land reverts to the estate. ridgeway wants to buy the resort in order to log the highly valuable timber located on the property. jesse adds that the land the town was built on was granted by jacob farnsworth on the condition that several buildings be erected, including two hospitals (one an animal hospital) and library. baxter\\'s son notes that he has not seen a library, and, in genuine confusion, asks why the land has not reverted to baxter. wigginton realizes that he is absolutely right, and that silver hill is in violation of the grant, meaning that the entire town is built on land now owned by baxter — including ridgeway\\'s bank. ridgeway, now finding himself on the back foot, finds himself being pressed by baxter for an extension on the loan, which is quickly granted. baxter pushes his advantage, and ridgeway quickly agrees to loan baxter the money necessary to not only repair but greatly expand the resort.',\n",

westrum was a severe alcoholic; he implies that sturmfuller was abusing his wife and possibly his daughter (this is made explicit in the novel); and the vigilantes intended to murder someone in cold blood (lowe\\'s logic cannot explain brady\\'s murder, however). lowe then apologizes and tells marty that he is going to drown him in the river when marty is unwittingly saved by local farmer elmer zinneman.\\r\\nthe siblings tell red about their letter-writing campaign to reverend lowe. after calming down the furious red, they manage to convince him that lowe is connected to the murders and attempted to kill marty: the silver bullet has dents and a scrape of blue paint that matches lowe\\'s car. unable to deny the evidence in front of him, red heads straight to sheriff haller. although red admits that he has his doubts, and haller does not believe lowe to be a killer, red nonetheless persuades the sheriff to investigate. that night, haller, still skeptical but desperate to find the killer, is shocked to discover evidence that at least some of marty\\'s story may be true. haller suddenly finds lowe, who has locked himself in his garage to restrain himself from further killings, but before haller can arrest him, lowe transforms and kills haller by striking him numerous times on the head with the peacemaker.\\r\\nmarty and jane both know that with haller out of the way, the werewolf now has an easy path to come after them. marty theorizes that lowe transforms more often than just the full moon, but that when the moon is at its peak he loses all his humanity and becomes more driven to kill; thus, he will attack marty on the next full moon, when he is most unrestrained. desperate and running out of options, they convince red to take jane\\'s silver cross and marty\\'s silver medallion to someone who can melt it down into a silver bullet. under the guise of marty having just \"discovered the lone ranger\", red has a local gunsmith make the bullet; the gunsmith proves to be a master at his craft, making the bullet so it will be accurate. when red asks an offhand question, \"… what the heck are you gonna shoot a forty-four bullet at anyway, made outta silver?\" the gunsmith replies, \"how \\'bout a werewolf?\"\\r\\non halloween, red shows up at the coslaws with some fortuitous news: he has won a romantic getaway to new york, but since he separated from his wife, he gives the tickets to nan and bob. questioned by marty and jane, red reveals that he bought the tickets as a ruse to get their parents to safety. with the now full moon in the sky, they head inside to wait for the werewolf. despite their best efforts, the three fall asleep and are startled awake when red (who has fallen asleep with a lit cigarette in his fingers), burns himself, jumps up and drops the gun, nearly setting it off. red begins to doubt that the werewolf is real, much less going to show up, and orders marty and jane to bed. jane suddenly screams in horror as she sees the werewolf looking at her from a living room window, although when red looks he finds nothing. red starts to think that he is being fooled by the children and unloads the pistol. at that moment the werewolf tears the power cables out of the box and cuts the power to the house, leaving the trio with only the light from the fireplace. the werewolf then smashes through the wall of the house, attacking them. despite red\\'s best efforts he is tossed around like a rag doll and jane is suspended in midair.as uncle red continues to receive multiple wwe style body slams into various pieces of household furniture,marty manages to retrieve the cartridge (which was tossed around in the melee and had fallen through a heating vent in the floor) and shoots the werewolf in the right eye with the silver bullet. the corpse turns back into reverend lowe and has one last spasm before dying. afterwards marty and jane both say, \"i love you\" and the narrator then says that she too can now say it.',\n",

he accepts.\\r\\nmonte has his doubts about lucy, so he strikes a deal with jeanette (matlin), a deaf colleague: jeanette will marry him if he pays her $10,000. this leads to a conversation monte has on the phone with his friend. lucy overhears the conversation and decides to eavesdrop. he explains to his friend his intention to rob the restaurant, and asks his friend to help, who declines.\\r\\nlucy confronts monte while they are waiting for her turn at the audition. both become frustrated because they both want to rob the restaurant at the same time. lucy is called up and begins her escape routine. unfortunately, the audition goes disastrously as she cannot find the key to free herself. lucy is obviously upset so monte takes her to a bar where they discuss who's going to rob the restaurant. they can't work together, as that would mean splitting the money, and monte needs it all to pay jeanette. monte comes up with another plan: he will help lucy rob the restaurant if she marries him. this way, monte won't need the $10,000 to pay jeanette.\\r\\nlucy begins to cry again so monte tries to cheer her up by talking about mrs. houdini. lucy, still upset, explains that mrs. houdini was vital to harry houdini's escape routines: before mr. houdini commenced with his trick, mrs. houdini would kiss him and transfer the key he needed to escape from her mouth to his. lucy's mood has improved somewhat after this so the two walk down the street and discuss the possibility of sleeping together. monte wants to, but lucy declines and explains viv was hoping to sleep with him first. with viv in mind, he suggests that a third person that doesn't work at the restaurant and wouldn't be recognised would be ideal for the robbery. lucy agrees and the two head to vivian's apartment, where she's working on her 'self-defence bra'.\\r\\nit's later on when the trio discuss the plan: at 12:00 am, viv will enter the restaurant and demand money, which she will take from the register. to appear more threatening, she will carry a gun which fires blanks. it's vitally important that it happens before the 12:30 am drop. monte and lucy will create some clever diversions so that the guests will be on edge. at 11:59, they will drop a loud set of glasses to really unsettle the guests; seconds later, viv will enter. viv reluctantly agrees and takes the gun from monte.\\r\\nat 11:59, monte and lucy drop the champagne bottles and glasses... but viv doesn't show up. thinking she has dropped out, monte storms off, and lucy follows. she finds him in the freezer causing havoc and messing the room up. with adrenaline rushing through him, he makes out with lucy. as it turns out, viv had a flat tyre on her bike, so by the time she turns up in a disguise to commence the robbery the guests are calm and don't take her seriously. she makes threats but the guests laugh at her, so she pretends she's a performing artist and the stunt was part of her act.\\r\\nin the freezer, lucy flees the room, leaving monte confused. she tracks down vivian, who explains what happened. the situation is desperate and 12:30 looms, so viv fires the gun, exclaiming, 'sorry, i guess i wasn't kidding... money. now. all of it.' jeanette, who works at the register, can't understand vivian because the disguise is covering her face. annoyed, viv presses a button on her bra, which causes two knife-like spikes to stick out of it. jeanette is fascinated and happily hands over a bag of money. lucy and monte leave the restaurant and later all three of them can be seen throwing money into the air, celebrating.\\r\\nexpecting lucy to uphold her side of the deal, monte heads to the register office and waits for her. meanwhile, lucy heads back to the antique shop to buy the ring, only to find it has been sold. she heads over to viv's apartment to mope. viv's in a cheerful mood, however: since the robbery, companies have been calling her about her 'self-defence bra'. lucy doesn't share the enthusiasm. viv asks if she and monte tied the knot. lucy realises she completely forgot, so she and vivian rush to the register office.\\r\\nthe girls arrive and monte whisks lucy away, but they are not able to marry because she left her i.d. at viv's apartment. there is simply no time to get married any other day, so monte leaves in anger. the two girls leave, too, and lucy, full of guilt, confesses to vivian that she made out with monte. the two talk about him before deciding to head to a bar and get drunk.\\r\\nmonte, meanwhile, is at the restaurant when cecil and dante approach him. it is revealed that monte didn't need to get married to get his green card, but because he made a $2,000,000 bet with cecil and dante. we also learn that monte has a terrible gambling problem. he manages to convince them to give him another chance, and they make another bet: lucy will have one minute to escape from a straitjacket, hanging upside down, with her feet cuffed, inside a locked canvas bag, underwater (in cecil and dante's giant aquarium at the restaurant). if she is unable to, monte will owe them $4,000,000, or, he will undergo plastic surgery to make himself look like dante.\\r\\nof course, monte can't win without lucy's help. he arrives at lucy's apartment, where the two girls are asleep. he wakes them up and discovers they have serious hangovers. worried that they won't help him, monte makes up a story, 'cecil and dante know about the robbery... i don't know how they found out... there's still hope. i made a deal- a bet-a bet with cecil and dante: if we win, they drop all charges, like nothing ever happened... [if we lose,] 20 years hard labour'. vivian and monte believe that they can train lucy, but quickly, for the stunt is to be performed the following night. lucy trains for hours, and before long, the three fall asleep, exhausted. vivian wakes up in the early hours of the morning and leaves, which, in turn, causes monte and lucy to wake up. lucy wants to get up and train, but monte convinces her to stay, and the two make love in lucy's apartment.\\r\\nlater in the morning, lucy is out shopping and sees cecil and dante driving past in a taxi. she tries to avoid them, but they drag her into the vehicle so they can rant about their excitement for the bet. after a bit of chatting, lucy finds out that cecil and dante don't know who committed the robbery, even though monte told her they knew. she discovers that monte will have to pay cecil and dante $4,000,000 (or get plastic surgery) if he doesn't win the bet, even though monte told her they'd go to jail if the bet was lost. lucy is visibly shocked and asks the driver to stop before climbing out of the taxi.\\r\\nit's the night of the bet and monte is nervous, particularly because lucy hasn't showed up. monte learns that cecil and dante told her the truth about the bet. he now doubts that she will show, but begs the two men to stall the audience until she comes, so they do. lucy finally shows up, surprising cecil, dante, and monte. after an awkward arrival, she puts on the straitjacket, has her legs cuffed, and is almost in the canvas bag when monte interrupts, wanting a 'goodbye kiss'. lucy, still angry at him, refuses, until she sees he has mrs. houdini's wedding ring between his teeth.\\r\\nlucy is locked in the bag, suspended upside down, and dropped into the water. she appears to be struggling to escape when several gun shots fire. it's vivian, dressed in a red disguise but with the same black veil covering her face. she presses her 'self-defence bra' and the spikes once again stick out. she demands money and the audience give it to her whilst monte stares in shock. jeanette also gives her two bags of money from the register.\\r\\nwhen viv leaves, the attention turns back to lucy. the canvas bag is still in the water. monte- aware that if he tries to save her, he will lose the bet- jumps into the water, before finding out that the bag is devoid of lucy. the audience is confused until they find her on the second level of the restaurant, dripping from the water but otherwise fine.\\r\\nlater on, monte is still somewhat damp but approaches lucy nonetheless. she's less angry with him since he risked $4,000,000 to save her, but she shakes his hand and prepares to leave him for the last time. monte calls her back and asks if she will go out with him the following day, but this time, it's for real. the two kiss before lucy leaves. outside, viv is waiting by two new bikes from cecil and dante and the movie ends with the two girls riding down the dark street.\",\n",

harvey, who is especially gifted with children, follows to see if he can help. when they get back to april\\'s compartment, she confides in patsy that ivan may have a point in what he had said on their way to the station, about being at home, nurturing her very own child - and a young husband. realising that she is thinking of marrying harvey, patsy rushes back to ivan\\'s compartment to break the news to him. meanwhile, harvey is rather taken aback by the baby\\'s similar appearance to april\\'s, almost as if he were her own. april tries to explain that it is merely a publicity stunt, but harvey cannot bring himself to believe this, and when she asks for ivan\\'s support, unaware that he is fearful of losing his leading lady, he denies that he had anything to do with it. displeased at being fooled, harvey walks out and returns to the observation saloon, and an angry april forces ivan and patsy out of her compartment along with the baby.\\r\\nat fort wayne, mike hands his engine, k4 no. 3763, over to the relief crew and joins the train itself. while he is waiting in the dining car for patsy, he is briefly harassed by a small boy before being joined at his table by harvey. patsy enters the dining car a little later with april and miss prottle. seeing harvey at mike\\'s table, april tries once again to reason with him, but harvey still doesn\\'t believe her. in the end she gets her way by telling him that ivan was the father. ivan soon approaches her table with the baby, and is confused when harvey threatens to knock his teeth down his throat before storming off, but april smugly repeats to ivan what she had said to harvey. horrified, ivan leaves the baby with april and flees to his compartment to pack his suitcase, ordering the train porter to stop the train and let him off in spite of it being scheduled to run straight through to harrisburg. the porter has only just gone to talk to the guard about it when harvey comes to interrogate ivan. before he can do so, ivan reveals to him that it was indeed a mere publicity stunt, leaving harvey rather ashamed of himself.\\r\\nin the dining car, mike has joined patsy and miss prottle on their table and is explaining to miss prottle about various aspects of railroading. he has just finished explaining how he once avoided crashing into a derailed wagon when a goods train flashes past, causing mike to leap from his seat and yell a greeting. he explains to patsy and miss prottle that a friend/relative was driving the goods engine. eventually, patsy and miss prottle head off to help april with the baby, but before she leaves, patsy and mike agree to meet in the observation car later on. in the observation car, mike is just leafing through a newspaper when another passenger comments about the pierson kidnapping, which is still making headline news. he adds that the last such crime was foiled in just three weeks, the kidnapper being sentenced to death while the accomplice, who didn\\'t realise that the kid had been taken hostage in the first place, was given 177 years - effectively a life sentence. mike is shocked when he reads that the baby in question is similar in appearance to the one lent to april tremaine, and was believed to have been heading east. when he sees that the other passenger is a detective, he hastily leaves the saloon and heads for patsy\\'s compartment to check the baby for the one detail that hasn\\'t been seen yet; a mole on his left shoulder.\\r\\nby this time, patsy and miss prottle have the baby ready for bed, but miss prottle insists on staying up late to listen to \"renfrew of the mounted\", a radio series of which she is a big fan. mike hastily offers to look after the baby briefly while they go and listen to the latest installment on the observation saloon radio. as soon as they have gone, the suspicious character looks through the door and remarks to mike about the baby, adding that he will be right outside if he needs any help. he shuts the door behind him, and mike pulls the baby\\'s shirt down to look at his shoulder. sure enough, he sees a dark patch similar to a mole.\\r\\nin the observation saloon, \"renfrew of the mounted\" is just finishing when mike comes in and tries to explain their dilemma to patsy while miss prottle takes charge of the baby, but patsy is so annoyed at his anxious rambling that she mistakes it for lack of interest in her, and accordingly walks out on him. realising that he is on his own, mike reacts by collecting every newspaper in the train before discarding them through the carriage window. in the observation saloon, meanwhile, harvey tries to apologise to april for his misunderstanding, but april refuses to hear him out. ivan, who had opted to stay on the train after all, steps in and reminds harvey that he is a mere, underpaid doctor, and advises that he shouldn\\'t interfere with her career any longer. although suspicious that ivan may have ulterior motives, harvey reluctantly agrees; however, his guilt quickly catches up with him again, and his attempts to make up with april are constantly foiled by ivan staring warily out of his compartment. ironically, every time he himself tries to talk with april, harvey catches him out. this goes on until they catch mike leaving april\\'s compartment. both are taken aback by this, unaware that mike was really helping to open april\\'s suitcase.\\r\\nlater that night, patsy is woken by a sleepless mike, who tells her that, unbeknown to him until too late, the baby had been kidnapped. thankfully, patsy has a plan, and puts mike in charge of the baby until they get a chance to drop him off at a station. mike takes the baby back to his compartment and keeps him occupied by telling him \"the three bears\" until he falls asleep mid-story. shortly, patsy comes and informs him that the train has made an unscheduled stop. mike takes this opportunity to leave the baby in the booking office of the nearby station, but just as he leaves the building, the suspicious man finds the baby with a note in his crib: \"please return to chicago; notify police\". he screws up the note and surreptitiously returns the baby to april\\'s compartment. when mike returns, he finds that the train is being held up for two and a half hours; there is a flood in the valley, and the express engine has been commandeered to take a consignment of coal trucks to the town affected by the flood. the other engine, a d16, is unable to make it fast enough. mike suggests that they use the smaller engine to pull the broadway limited, but the driver and fireman are sceptical, saying that they \"couldn\\'t get enough head on that to haul the limited around the block\". mike however is insistent, and challenges the superintendent, mulcany, into firing the engine for him. with that, mike and mulcany prepare the d16 while no. 3673 is shunted onto the coal trucks. the d16 slips violently at first, but with careful handling and some sand on the rails, mike manages to get the express rolling again.\\r\\nback on the train, miss prottle realises that the baby is missing and frantically tells ivan, who orders the guard to call for the police. patsy overhears and rushes miss prottle back to bed before repeating to ivan what mike had told her. realising that they are headed for prison cells if the police are sent for, ivan rushes off to order the guard not to send off the message, only to find he is too late. but almost immediately after he finds this out, he remembers that the baby is missing anyway, so they have no need to worry.\\r\\nmeanwhile, april is woken up to find the baby on her bedside table. although confused at first as to how the baby got into her compartment and why he is wide awake, she sees a chance to make up her dispute with harvey, and asks the porter to send for him. when harvey arrives, he deduces that the baby just isn\\'t tired, much to april\\'s relief, but kindly offers to stay and keep an eye on him. by this time april is beginning to realise just how right ivan was about babies, and expresses to harvey a desire to have one of her own. ivan\\'s words are still playing on harvey\\'s mind, however, and he is therefore rather pessimistic about this until april tells him that she has had enough of making films with ivan. they both head off to ivan\\'s compartment, where april confesses her love to harvey, and the two of them share a kiss just as ivan opens his door. ivan is horrified, not only because harvey went back on his word, but also at april\\'s intention to quit from hollywood and marry harvey. they leave ivan pacing back and forth in his compartment, ranting and raving to himself in russian as he tries desperately to work out a way round it.\\r\\nby dawn, ivan is still pacing in his compartment, unable to sleep, when he hits on a compromise whereby (he hopes) everyone will win. excited, he heads off to harvey\\'s compartment and, admitting that he has been rather heartless up till now, proposes to build harvey\\'s life-ambition - \"the finest clinic that science can dream up/money can buy\". harvey is unconvinced at first, but ivan promises to pay him the required $50,000 and give him a contract before he leaves the train. while they are discussing this, the express enters harrisburg, where it is to change engines and proceed to new york behind a gg1 electric locomotive. as soon as they have stopped, mulcany congratulates mike on his expert handling of the little d16 and wishes him a nice holiday. mike returns to the train feeling pleased with himself, unaware that the police have begun to search the limited for the baby. following a brief visit from one of the policemen, ivan confides in harvey about their predicament, and is shocked to hear from harvey that the baby is still aboard the train. he runs back to april\\'s compartment, where april is just dressing the baby for the day, and explains to her how he had been kidnapped. patsy enters shortly after, and is shocked to find the baby on april\\'s bed. ivan hands her the baby and forces her into her own compartment before hastily organising a ruse with april; as soon as the policeman enters, april pretends to be distraught while ivan keeps him occupied for a short while.\\r\\nback in patsy\\'s compartment, mike comes to inform patsy that everything is under control - but patsy reveals that the baby is back aboard the train, much to his bewilderment. he takes the baby back into april\\'s compartment just in time to avoid being caught out by miss prottle and the policeman, whom miss prottle mistakes for \"renfrew of the mounted\".\\r\\nthe policemen soon come to the conclusion that the baby isn\\'t on the train, and head back to make their report. with the coast clear and the engines changed, mike heads to his compartment with the baby while ivan, patsy, april and harvey try to find a way out of their crisis. ivan suggests that they get off at philadelphia, but patsy reminds him that they will be rounded up by the police even if they don\\'t stay on the train until new york. at philadelphia, the suspicious man is met by another two men, who join the train for the last few miles to new york. back in april\\'s compartment, patsy, harvey, april and ivan are still desperately trying to find a solution to their problem - until miss prottle points out that they are all heroes. harvey and april realise that they needn\\'t have worried about the baby after all; they just have to hand him to the police, and they will be on the front page of every newspaper in the usa. at that moment, mike comes in and announces that he is going to surrender as soon as they reach new york, to which all eagerly agree. patsy sends him to get the baby, and mike, elated when he hears that they will all be received to a hero\\'s welcome, instantly obliges. shortly after, the guard hands ivan the contract and a $50,000 cheque for the clinic. harvey is just signing the contract when mike bursts back into the room in a panic, saying that the baby has gone. all six of them spread out to look for the baby, whom mike eventually finds with the suspicious stranger. he approaches him, demanding the baby back, but the other two passengers try to restrain him. mike, however, is too strong for them, and knocks them down before hanging the suspicious passenger on the coat-hanger. patsy enters and is about to take the baby when the other two passengers come round and bar her way, only to be overpowered once again by mike.\\r\\non arrival at pennsylvania station, it is revealed that the pierson baby had been found the night before, and that the suspicious-looking man was actually the baby\\'s father; he had let them use the baby for the publicity stunt on the basis that he could use the $500 reward for a family reunion. the other two characters, he adds, are his brother and brother-in-law from philadelphia. mike points out what he believes is a mole on the baby\\'s shoulder, but it turns out to be a false beauty mark that miss prottle had lost. with their misunderstanding sorted out, patsy heads off to niagara falls with mike while the flustered father leaves for his reunion. before harvey and april leave, however, they read through the contract and find that the clinic is to be located right across the street from ivan\\'s studio, possibly indicating that ivan intended to keep april as his leading lady without interfering too much with her private life with harvey. as for miss prottle, she chases after another policeman, once again believing him to be renfrew.',\n",

his company investment plan. he bids farewell to miss otis (frances ramsden), a young woman who works at an artist\\'s desk down the aisle, giving her the paid-for engagement ring that he had, having planned to marry each of her six older sisters (hortense, irma, harriet, margie, claire, and rosemary) when they had worked there before her. he wanders out, aimlessly through the streets, his life\\'s savings in his trouser pocket.\\r\\nwhile looking through the newspaper want ads for another job, harold is approached by wormy (jimmy conlin), a local con artist, petty gambler, and racetrack tout, who asks harold for some money so he can place a bet. seeing the large amount of cash that harold has, and hoping to get him drunk enough to acquire some of the cash, wormy takes the depressed and unemployed harold to a local bar for a drink. when harold tells the bartender, jake (edgar kennedy), that he has never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \"the diddlebock\", one sip of which is enough to release harold from all his inhibitions. the effects of the alcohol causes harold to yowl uncontrollably. gazing at himself in the bar mirror, harold suddenly declares himself a loser and races out to remake himself. soon harold is getting his hair cut and his nails manicured at a local tailor shop and salon, and is trying on a gaudy plaid suit supplied by tailor formfit franklin (franklin pangborn). in the midst of his transformation, harold overhears wormy talking with his bookie max (lionel stander), and impulsively bets $1,000 of his money on a 15-to-one long shot horse named emmaline. to everyone\\'s surprise, emmaline wins, and the now-rich harold, with $15,000 in his pockets, begins to celebrate all around town on a day-and-a-half binge of spending, gambling, and carousing.\\r\\na few days later, harold wakes up on the sofa inside the house of his widowed sister flora (margaret hamilton) where she chastises him for his wild, irresponsible behavior. he finds that he has a hangover, but he also has a garish new wardrobe and a ten-gallon cowboy hat. unable to remember much about his drunken binge, particularly about what he did on wednesday which is a total blank, harold wanders outside to return the plaid suit where he is surprised to learn that he now owns a hansom horse-drawn cab complete with an english driver named thomas (robert greig). a worried wormy then rushes up and informs harold that, with winnings from a second bet, harold also bought a bankrupt circus. after a meeting with the animal handlers and circus freaks, harold first seeks help from the kitt-poo home for cats to feed the circus\\' starving lions and tigers. seeing no future with the ownership of the circus, harold then gets the idea to sell the circus to a wall street banker.\\r\\nharold and wormy visit the circus-loving wall street banker lynn sargent (rudy vallee) to ask him to purchase their circus, but he turns them down because he is trying to unload his own bankrupt circus. when the rest of the town\\'s bankers follow suit, harold comes up with an idea. to get past the bank guards, harold dresses up in his plaid suit and brings along jackie, a tame circus lion, who incites panic. carrying a filled thermos, wormy gives shot drinks of the potent \"diddlebock\" cocktail to each of the bankers they visit so their inhibitions will fade and convince them to put in bids for ownership of the circus. things take a turn for the worse when the lion gets loose, in which harold, wormy, and the lion end up on the ledge of a skyscraper, but narrowly avoid plunging to certain death.\\r\\naccording to harold\\'s plan, the three (harold, wormy, and jackie the lion) are arrested and thrown in jail. miss otis bails them out the following day, and they find that the publicity has attracted a mob of bankers at the jail who want to buy the circus – but ringling brothers outbids them. harold celebrates with another \"diddlebock\", and again has another relapse. in the final scene, harold wakes up another day or two later in the horse-drawn cab with miss otis where he learns that he received $175,000 for the sale of the circus, he is now an executive at waggleberry\\'s advertising agency, and that he and miss otis are married. reassuring harold that she truly loves him, miss otis gives him a big kiss, and harold finally remembers what he was doing all day on wednesday. the final shot shows wormy tagging along with them by riding on the back bumper of the cab.[3][4]',\n",

              " ('in 1942, a few months after america\\'s entry into world war ii, secretary ruth wood (jane wyman) lives quietly in manhattan with her physically and emotionally fragile mother, agnes (josephine hutchinson). ruth\\'s co-workers at excelsior shoe manufacturing company are her best friend grace ullman (eileen heckart) and millie kranz (peggie castle), an attractive blonde involved in an affair with her married boss, stephen jalonik (fred clark). also in the office is monty (arte johnson), a young shipping clerk classified by the draft as 4-f, who monitors the war\\'s campaigns on a world map pinned to the wall.\\r\\none evening after work, when a cloudburst forces ruth and other pedestrians to take shelter in the vestibule of an office building, arthur hugenon (van johnson), a cheerful, talkative g.i. stationed in the area, surprises the shy ruth by starting a conversation. when he invites her to dinner, she declines, saying that her housebound mother is expecting her. undeterred, art buys food for three at a delicatessen and accompanies ruth home. agnes, who has distrusted men since her husband harry left her for another woman ten years earlier, receives art with little enthusiasm. during the meal, art, who grew up on a tennessee farm, captivates ruth with his stories and afterward entertains them by playing harry\\'s piano. upon finding the manuscript of an unfinished melody harry composed, art asks permission to take it back to camp, where he and his army buddy dixie will write lyrics for it. when weekend arrives, art takes ruth and grace to a matinee and, as they afterwards walk to a restaurant, passing an auction, ruth impulsively bids on an antique roman coin, which she gives to art for good luck. while the trio is enjoying dinner at the café normandy, ruth is unaware that the piano player is her father (william gargan), whom she has not seen since he left agnes. however, harry recognizes ruth and confides to his bartender friend andy that he has been too ashamed to return to his family.\\r\\nlater, ruth tells art that agnes tried to kill herself after harry left and still hopes for his return. art arrives late for their next sunday date, but brings the lyrics he and dixie have written to harry\\'s music, entitled \"i\\'ll always believe in you\", which he sings together with ruth. as they go out and walk through central park, ruth voices fears about the war and art tells her she must have faith. they then encounter sergeant gil parker (alan king), while he takes snapshots of his new bride, arlene witchy (barbara nichols), who works as a singer. gil asks art to take their picture and then offers to photograph art and ruth. in private, gil warns art that his division will soon be shipped overseas, but art refuses to believe the rumor. at the lagoon, where children are sailing toy boats, art recognizes the name of an elderly man, commodore eli b. windgate (halliwell hobbes), nicknamed \"windy\", a former yachtsman who owned many of the surrounding buildings before losing his fortune in the crash of \\'29. hoping to be a reporter after the war, art senses a good story and interviews windy on the spot. he then goes with ruth to the new york times building and convinces the city editor (unbilled grandon rhodes) to let him write it as a human interest story. instead of taking payment, art asks to be considered for a reporting job after the war. a couple of days later, as ruth waits to meet him for their pre-arranged date, art arrives late, riding on a truck filled with other soldiers, including dixie (unbilled paul smith). with only a brief moment remaining before the truck\\'s departure for the port where the troop ship awaits, he asks ruth to marry him when he returns and, to allay her fears, says he still has the lucky roman coin.\\r\\nfor three months, ruth writes to art every day, but receives no letters in return. finally, a special delivery man knocks on the apartment door and hands a letter from a battlefield chaplain informing her that art died in combat and that his dying wish was that she be told about his love for her. ruth\\'s tear drops on the letter and, in the following days and weeks, she is inconsolable despite the best efforts of her friends and co-workers. millie, moved by ruth\\'s misfortune, feels the need for a fresh and pure start, drops jalonik as her lover and leaves the firm. grace finds ruth consumed by grief, sitting on a bench in central park, and takes her to st. patrick\\'s cathedral, where ruth lights candles under the statue of saint andrew. jalonik, hoping ruth will fill the void left in his extra-marital life by millie, takes her to café normandy and attempts to engage in a warm-up conversation, but ruth is in such a despairing state that she pays no attention as he kisses her on the cheek. a few feet to the side, at the bar, harry has the radio on and hears the familiar strains of his music since, before shipping out, dixie made suggestions to art as to the possibility of marketing harry\\'s music with art\\'s lyrics as a professional song. puzzled, harry dials agnes\\' number but, at the sound of her voice, his resolve falters and he hangs up without speaking. having written numerous letters of explanation and contrition to agnes, he continually found himself tearing them to bits, because of inability to face the hurt he caused her.\\r\\nruth has been returning to the statue of st. andrew and talking to the cathedral\\'s young priest (paul picerni). losing interest in life, she ignores a cold, which turns into pneumonia. mrs. hamer, the upstairs neighbor who has often helped ruth care for agnes, now helps agnes nurse the bedridden ruth. one rainy night, while agnes has dozed off near her bedside, the feverish ruth leaves the apartment just before harry finally musters the courage to walk in with the intention of asking agnes\\' forgiveness for leaving. stunned at seeing him, agnes also realizes that ruth is missing, just as grace telephones. upon being told that ruth has left her sickbed, grace realizes that she must be heading for the cathedral.\\r\\nstanding on the cathedral steps, consumed by fever, ruth hears art\\'s voice speaking her name. delirious, she sees art materialize and slowly approach close enough for an embrace or a kiss as he tells her that love never dies. no longer possessing earthly means of holding on to the roman coin she gifted to him, art returns it to ruth. a moment later, in the midst of the heavy, late evening rain, the priest finds ruth unconscious on the steps, just as grace arrives. seeing the coin clasped in ruth\\'s hand, he shows it to grace, who recognizes it and realizes that, for a brief moment, art had returned to ruth, whose own tenuous hold on life remains clouded in uncertainty at the final fadeout.',\n",

c’mon man kirkby is bad news. wedding receptions worse news. a wedding reception in kirkby is a disaster! there’s always some knob head going through your records and there’s always a fight.” still, the pair turn up and as ritchie predicts it kicks off big style, so they make their getaway - quick - only to find the van breaks down on the way.\\r\\nritchie then introduces john to kecks (postlethwaite) a british rail buffet car attendant with high ambitions who sold the van to ritchie. after a quick drink and a french revolution, kecks tells them to “take it to our kid\\'s in the morning and he will fix it free of charge.” then offers them a bit of paid work moving some gear from his lock up.\\r\\nthe following night ritchie and john arrive outside kecks\\'s lock up to find a strange noise coming from within. ”what’s he doing in there, drilling for oil?” ritchie queries.\\r\\nkecks appears with a number of parcels which they load into the van and take to kecks\\'s flat. when they arrive, kecks tells the lads to go on up to his flat while he locks up their van, but sneakily hides a parcel in the freezer compartment.\\r\\nwhen the parcels are safely in kecks\\'s flat he gives the lads £20 and says, “errr and if anything else goes wrong with the van, tough shit!“ and closes the door on them. ritchie and john then head for the nearest pub, commenting how one minute you\\'re down and then you\\'re up again. as they order their beer, the bartender notes “and then your right back down again!” as he shows the £20 note as an obvious fake.\\r\\nthey hurry back to kecks\\'s flat and arrive just as he is trying to leave wearing a poor quality disguise. they force kecks to tell them what’s going on and he tells them that he has stolen some printing plates for £20 notes from a heavy duty villain in london and is about to skip the country with his little bundle of counterfeit notes, but he’s hidden the plates in the van and was going to ring the lads when he was abroad to ask if they would deliver them to a contact in parkestone.\\r\\nbut the bloke won’t be there till later in the week so they would have to sit on the plates for a few days. “that’s great, that is! you piss off out of liverpool and we have to hang about and listen for cockney accents,” ritchie points out. kecks replies, “you’re a mobile disco, stay mobile.\" after being offered £1000 for delivery and another £1000 on arrival, they reluctantly agree. when kecks asks for a lift to the airport, they say “not a chance,“ and leave.\\r\\nas they leave, they pass a couple of guys on the stairs who make a comment about the weather. after a few moments, john and richie realize that these men had cockney accents, so they jump in their van and head off to parkestone. as they have a few days to travel, they decide to zig-zag to their destination because they are worried about being pursued by the cockney gangsters and the police. they encounter various comical situations and romantic moments on their travels across country to deliver the plates. on catching a news bulletin, they are startled to discover that the police are looking for two men in connection with kecks\\' murder.\\r\\nthey stay at a small hotel, complete with llama in the garden, and richie implies to the hotel owner\\'s pretty daughter, susan(lunghi) that he and john are musicians travelling with earth, wind and fire. richie is obviously very attracted to susan, but it is john\\'s bed that susan visits in the night. after a passionate encounter, john admits to susan that he and richie aren\\'t anything to do with earth, wind and fire and are currently working as djs. he then admits that he is actually a pilot with the united states air force, but has gone awol. he tells susan that if he remains absent for much longer he will be classed as a deserter.\\r\\nafter leaving the hotel and stopping off to refuel, richie offers a lift to an american soldier named curtis whose car has broken down. john is very uncomfortable with this arrangement because curtis needs a lift to a us air force base. john becomes increasingly agitated, particularly when curtis insists that he and richie join him for a beer inside the base. curtis then invites them to perform a dj gig in the soldiers\\' canteen bar. richie is very excited to perform there, but cannot understand john\\'s reluctance and performs alone. during the gig, curtis takes to the stage as singer with the tac wing r&b allstars, singing, knock on wood which john clearly enjoys and he begins to relax a little. curtis invites volunteers to perform with the allstars and richie persuades john to join him on stage where the two sing driftaway to rapturous applause. one of the soldiers in the audience comments that he recognizes john.\\r\\njohn and richie leave the base and their friendship of two weeks is clearly strengthened by the experience. they continue on their journey to parkestone only to discover that the two cockney gangsters have arrived first and murdered the recipient. the gangsters threaten them with a sawn-off shotgun, but are then plunged into a vat of grain when richie pulls a nearby leaver and their feet are seen protruding from a lorry load of grain leaving the processing plant.\\r\\nthe police arrive and richie realizes that they have come for john when he sees military personnel getting out of the police car. john gets into the car without fuss, asking richie to look after his records. richie then discovers the plates that kecks hid in the fridge in their van and smiles to himself.\\r\\nthe last scene occurs months later at the military detention centre in massachusetts, usa. richie is resplendent in white, with a cowboy-style hat, fringed leather coat and boots, and a very large white american car. he is there to collect john who has been detained as a punishment for going awol. john is surprised to see richie and the difference in him since they last met. richie explains that he was \"left some money\" and that they have a gig in pasadena. john points out that pasadena is 5000 miles away, so richie replies that they had better get a move on, playing some fantastic motown tunes on the way. the two friends depart and the car is seen driving away into the distance as the credits roll.',\n",

mob, watch their latest flashmob air on the television news in a restaurant kitchen of the dimont hotel where they work as waiters. a few complain about their public disturbance, while others praise it. after they get off work, they sneak into the hotel\\'s beach club, claiming to be guests, not employees.\\r\\nmeanwhile, across the club at the bar, emily anderson (kathryn mccormick) tries to get the bartender\\'s attention, but ends up preparing her own beer. sean, who is immediately smitten by her, asks for a beer. she tells him it\\'s on the house, then heads down to the beach to dance, resulting in a dance battle between the two, but ending with emily suddenly running off when she sees one of her dad\\'s business partners, trip.\\r\\nthe next day, emily and her father william

sean\\'s presence. after emily notices sean and warms up to him, she explains to him that she\\'s trying to nail an audition for the prestigious winwood dance academy company, which she is already a pupil of. sean advises her to incorporate faster, more interesting moves, but emily declines, saying that there are rules. sean, in turn, tells her to break the rules, giving her an address and telling her to come there. emily does and finds herself at the miami museum of fine arts, where the paintings and statues come to life, which is work of the mob. by telling her to attend, sean
